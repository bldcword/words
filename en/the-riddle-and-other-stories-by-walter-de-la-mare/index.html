<p>*‚ÄòThk communicating of a man‚Äôs self to
his ftiend &hellip;. redoubleth joys, and cutteth
ffiefs in halfs.‚Äù</p>
<p>THE ALMOND TREE</p>
<p>M r old friend, &ldquo;the Count‚Äù as we used to call
him, made very strange acquaintances at
times. Let but a man have plausibility,
a point of view, a crotchet, an enthusiasm, he would
find in him an eager and exhilarating listener. And
though he was often deceived and disappointed in
his finds, the Count had a heart proof against lasting
disillusionment. I confess, however, that these
planetary cronies of his were rather disconcerting at
rimes. And 1 own that meeting him one afternoon
in the busy High Street, with a compardon on his
arm even more than usually voluble and odd ‚Äî
ow I crossed the road to avoid meeting the pair.</p>
<p>But the Count‚Äôs eyes had been too sharp for me.
He&rsquo; twitted me unmercifully with my snobt&gt;ishness.
&ldquo;I am afraid we must have appeared to avoM you
to-day,‚Äù he said ; and received my protestations with
contemptuous indifference.</p>
<p>But me next afternoon we took a walk together
over the heath ; and perhaps the sunslune, something
in the first freshness of the May weather, reminded
him of bygone days.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou remember that rather out-of-the-Y^orid
friend of mine yesterday that so shocked your i^mce
proprieties^ Richard ? Well, FU tell you a story.*&rsquo;
As close^ as I can recall this story of the Count‚Äôs
childhood 1 have here related it. 1 wish, chough,
I had my old friend^- gift for such things ; then,
pe^ps, ^ story ..might retain something of ^e
chS^ ki the reading whidb he gave to it in the</p>
<p>2 THE ALMOND TREE</p>
<p>telling. Perhaps that charm Ucs wholly in the memory
of his voice, ms companionship, his friendship. To
revive these, what task would be a burden ? . . .</p>
<p>*‚ÄòThe. house of my first remembrance, the house
that to my last hour on earth wiU seem home to me,
stood in a small green hollow on the verge of a wide
heath. Its five upper windows faced far eastwards
towards the weather-cocked tower of a villa^ which
rambled down the steep inclination of a hiu. And,
walking in its green old garden ‚Äî ah, Richard, the
crocuses, the w^iflowers, the violets ! ‚Äî ^you could see
in the eveimg the siding fields of com, and the
dark furrows where the evening star was stationed ;
and a little to the south, upon a crest, a rambling
wood of fir-ttees‚Äôand bracken.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe house, the garden, the deep quiet orchard,
all had been a wedding gift to my mother from a
great-aunt, a very old lady in a kind of turban,
whose shrewd eyes used to watch me put of her
picture, string in my high cane chair at m^l-times ‚Äî
with not a little keenness j sometimes, I fancied,
with a feint derision. Here passed by^ to the singing
of .the Ifrk, and the lamentation of autumn wind
md jain, the first long nine of all these heaped-iixp
inextricable years. Even now, my heart leads up
with longing to see again with those untutored eyes
the lofty clouds of evening ;^o hear again as then
I heard it the two small notes^^ the yellow-hammer
pq&gt;ing from his neen spray, t remember eye^
room of the old nouse, the, steep stairs, ^ lbci&gt;l
apple-scented pantry; I remmber ^ cobbles^
the scullery, the w4f, my old dead raven, ftic hies#</p>
<p>THE ALMOND TREE }</p>
<p>and whistling elms ; but best of all I temember
the unmeasured splendour of the heath, with its
gorse, and its deep canopy of simny air, the haven
of every wild bird of the morning.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMartha Rodd \ngas a mere prim snippet of a maid
then, pale and grave, with large contemplative,
Puritan eyes. Mrs. Ryder, in her stiff blue martial
print and twisted gold brooch, was cook. And be-
sides these, there was only old Thomas the gardener
(as out-of-doors, and as distantly seen a creature as
a dryad) ; my mother ; and that busy-minded Htde
boy, agog -in wits and stomach and spirit^-myself.
For ray rather seemed but a familiar guest in the
house, a guest ever eagerly desired and welcome,
but none too eager to remain.^ He was a dark man
with grey eyes and a long chin ; a face unusually
impassive, unusually mobile. Just as bis capricious
mood suggested, our little household was dejected
or wildly gay. I never shall forget the spirit of
delight he could conjure up at a whim, when my
mother would go singing up and down stairs, and in
her tiny parlour ; and Martha in perfect content would
pratde endlessly on to the cook, basting th^ twirling
sirloin, while f watched in the firelight. ‚Ä¢ And the
long summer evenings too, when my father wotdd
find a secret, a magic, a mystery in everything ; and
we would sit together in the orchard while he told
me tales, with the small green apples overhead, and
beyjpnd contorted branches, the first golden tw^gin:
of the moon. .. .</p>
<p>**It*8 an old picture how, Richard, but true to the
fiine. ^ '</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>THJS ALMOND TREE</p>
<p>‚Äú My father‚Äôs will, his word, his caprice, his frown,
these were the tables of the law in that small house-
hold. To my mother he was the very meaning of
her life. Only that little boy was in some wise in-
dependent, busy, inquisitive, dodle, sedate ; though
tirged to a bitterness of secret rebellion at times.
In nis childhood he experienced such hours of distress
as the years do not in mercy bring again to a heart
that may analyse as well as remember. Yet there
also sai^ to rest the fountain of life‚Äôs happin^s.
In among the gorse bushes were the green mansions
of the fairies ; along the furrows before his adven-
turous eyes stumbled crooked gnomes, hopped be-
witched robins. Ariel trebled m the simbeams and
glanced from the dewdrops ; and he heard the echo
of distant and magic waters in the falling of the sain.</p>
<p>‚Äò*But my father was never long at peace in the
house. Nothing satisfied him ; he must needs be at
an extreme. And if he was compelled to conceal his
discontent, there was something so bitter and im-
perious in his silence, so scomfid a sarcasm in his
speech, diat we could scarcely bear it. And the know-
ledge of the influence he had over us served only¬´‚Äòat
sum times to sharpen his contempt, a</p>
<p>‚ÄòT remember one summer‚Äôs evening we had beat
gathering strawberries. I carried a little w;lcker
basket^ and went rummaging under the aromatic
leaves, calling ever and ag^ my mother to see tiie
‚Äôtronenjous‚Äô berry I had found, hfartha was busy
beside me, vexed that her two hands could not serve
ber master quick enough. And iq, a wild rtuoufrbb
my mother my &amp;ther helped us pick. At</p>
<p>THE ALMOND TREE 5</p>
<p>dpest one he took het in his atms to fotoe it between
het lips ; and of all those pecked by the birds he made
a rhymed offering to Pan. And when the sun had
descended behind the hill, and the clamour of the
rooks had begun to wane in the elm-tops, he took
my mother on his arm, and we trooped all together
up the long straggling path, and across the grass,
carrying our spou of fruit into the cool dusky corri-
dor. As we passed into the gloaming I saw my
&rsquo;toother stoop impulsively and kiss his arm. He
brushed off her hand impatiently, and went into
his study. I heard the door shut. A moment after-
wards he called for candles. And, looking on those
two other faces in the twilight, I knew with the
intuition of childhood that he was suddenly sick
to death of us all; and I knew that my mother
shared my intuition. She sat down, and I beside
her, in her little parlour, and took up her sewing.
But her face had lost again all its girlishness as she
bent her head over the white linen.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think she was happier when my father was
away ; for then, free from anxiety to be for ever
pteasing his variable moods, she could entertain
nerself with hopes and preparations for his return,
^ere was a little green summer-house, or arbour,
in the garden, where she would sit alone, while the
swallows coursed in the evening air. Someti||ies,
too, she would take me for a long walk, listramg
distantly to my chatter, only, I think, that she might
entertain the pleasure of supposing that my famer
hoi^t have returned home umoreseea, and be even
how wdting to greet us. But these fancies would</p>
<p>6 THEALMONDTREB</p>
<p>forsake her. She would speak harshly and coldly
to me, and scold Martha for her owlishness, and find
nothing but vanity and mockery in all that but a
little while since had been her day-dream.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think she rarely knew where my father stayed
in his long absences from home. He would remain
with us for a week, and neglect us for a month. She
was too proud, and when he was himself, too ha|¬ªy
and hopeful to question him, and he seemed to de-
light in keeping his affairs secret from her. Indeed, he
sometimes appeared to pretend a mystery where none
was, and to endeavour in all things to maKc ids char-
acter and conduct appear quixotic and inexplicable.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo time went on. Yet, it seemed, as each mondi &rsquo;
passed by, the house was not so merry and happy &rsquo;
as before ; something was fading and vanishing that
would not return ; estrangement had pierced a little i
deeper. I think care at last put out of my mother‚Äôs
mind even the semblance of her former gaiety.
She sealed up her heart lest love should break forth ‚Ä¢
anew into the bleakness.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn Guy Fawkes‚Äô Day Martha told me at bed-
time that a new household had moved into the
village on the other side of the heath. After that
my father stayed away from us but seldom.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAt first my mother showed her pleasure in a
thousand ways, with dainties of her own fancy and
cooking, with ribbons in her dark hair, with new
songs (though she had but a small thin voice). She
read to please him ; and tired my legs out in useless
errands in his service. And a word of praise sufficed
her for many hours of difficulty. But bye-and-bye.</p>
<p>THE ALMOND TREE 7</p>
<p>when evening after evening was spent by my father
away from home, she began to be imeasy and de-
pressed ; and though she made no complaint, her
anxious face, the incessant interrogation of her eyes
vexed and irritated hirn beyond measure.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòWhere does my father go after dinner ?‚Äô I asked
Martha one night, when my mother was in my bed-
room, folding my clothes.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòHow dare you ask such a question ?‚Äô said my
mother, ‚Äòand how dare you talk to the child about
your master‚Äôs comings and goings ?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚Äò But where does he ?‚Äô I repeated to Martha,
when my mother was gone out of the room.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòSsh now. Master Nicholas,‚Äô she answered,
‚Äòdidn‚Äôt you hear what your mamma said ? She‚Äôs
vexed, poor lady, at master‚Äôs never spending a whole
day at home, but nothing but them cards, cards, cards,
every night at Mr. Grey‚Äôs. Why, often it‚Äôs twelve
and one in the morning when I‚Äôve heard his foot on
the gravel beneath the window. But there. I‚Äôll be
bound, she doesn‚Äôt man to speak unkindly. It‚Äôs a
terrible scourge is jealousy. Master Nicholas ; and
not generous or manly to give it cause. Mrs. Ryder
was kept a widow all along of jealousy, and but a
week before her wedding with her second.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòBut why is mother jealous of my father playing
cards ?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúMartha slipped my nightgown over my head.
‚ÄòSsh, Master Nicholas, little boys mustn‚Äôt ask so
many questions. And I hope when you are grown
up to be a man, my dear, you will be a comfort to
your mother. She needs it* poor soul, and sakes</p>
<p>8 THE ALMOND TREE</p>
<p>alive, just now of all times !‚Äô I looked inquisitively
into Martha‚Äôs face ; but she screened my eyes with
her hand ; and instead of further questions, I said
my prayers to her.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA tew days after this I was sitting with my
mother in her parlbur, holding her grey worsted for
her to wind, when my father entered the room and
bade me put on my hat and muffler. ‚ÄòHe is going
to pay a call with me,‚Äô he explained curtly. As I
went out of the room, I heard my mother‚Äôs q^uestion,
‚ÄòTo your friends at the Grange, I suppose ?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòYou may suppose whatever you please,‚Äô he
answered. I heard my mother rise to leave the room,
but he called her back and the door was shut. . . .</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe room in which the card-players sat was very
low-ceiled. A piano stood near the window, a rose-
wood table with a fine dark crimson work-basket
upon it by the fireside, and some little distance away,
a green card-table with candles burning. Mr. Grey
was a slim, elegant man, with a high, narrow fore-
head and long fingers. Major Aubrey was a short,
red-faced, rather taciturn man. There was also a
younger man with fair hair. They seemed to be on
the best of terms together ; and I helped to pack
the cards and to pile the silver coins, sipping a glass
of sherry with Mr. Grey. My father said little, paying
me no attention, but playing gravely with a very
slight frown.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAfter some little while the door opened, and a
lady appeared. This was Mr. Grey‚Äôs sister, Jane, I
learned. She seated herself at her work-table, and
drew me to het side.</p>
<p>THE ALMOND TREE 9</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòWell, SO this is Nicholas 1‚Äô she said. ‚ÄòOrisitNick?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòNicholas,‚Äô I said.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòOf course,‚Äô she said, smiling, ‚Äò and I like that
too, much the best. How very kind of you to come
to see me ! It was to keep me company, you know,
because I am very stupid at games, but I love talking.
Do you?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúI looked into her eyes, and knew we were friends.
She smiled again, with open lips, and touched my
mouth with her thimble . ‚ÄòNow, let me see, business
first, and ‚Äî me afterwards. You see I have three
different kinds of cake, because, I thought, I cannot
in the least tell which kind he‚Äôll like best. Could I
now ? Come, you shall choose.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe rose and opened the long door of a narrow
cupboard, looking towards the card-players as she
stooped. I remember the cakes to t^s day ; little
oval shortbreads stamped with a beehive, custards
and mince-pies ; and a great glass jar of goodies
which I carried in both arms round the little square
table. I took a mince-pie, and sat down on a foot-
stool near by Miss~Grey, and she talked to me while
she worked with slender hands at her lace embroidery.
I told her how old I was ; about my great-aunt and
her three cats. I told her my dreams, and that I was
very fond of Yorkshire pudding, ‚Äòfrom under the
meat, you know.‚Äô And I told her I thought my
father the handsomest man I had ever seen.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòWTiat, handsomer than Mr. Spencer ?‚Äô she said
laughing, looking along her needle.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI answered that I did not very much like
clergymen.</p>
<p>B</p>
<p>lO THE ALMOND TREE</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòAnd why ?‚Äô she said eravely.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚Äò Because they do not talk like real,* I said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe laughed very gaily. ‚ÄòDo men ever ?‚Äô she said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd her voice was so quiet and so musical, her
neck so graceful, I thought her a very beautiful lady,
admiring especially her dark eyes when she smiled
brightly and yet half sadly at me ; I promised, more-
over, that if she would meet me on the heath, I
would show her the rabbit warren and the ‚ÄòMiUcT‚Äôs
Pool.*</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòWell, Jane, and what do you think of my son?*
said my father when we were about to leave.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe bent over me and squeezed a lucky four-
penny-piece into my hand. ‚ÄòI love fourpence, pretty
little fourpence, I love fourpence better than my life,*
she whispered into my eat. ‚ÄòBut that‚Äôs a secret,*
she added, glancing up over her shoulder. She kissed
lightly the top of my head. I was looking at my
father while she was caressing me. and I fancied a
faint sneer passed over his face. But when we had
come out of the village on to the heath, in the bare
keen night, as we wSked along the path together
between the gorse-bushes, now on turf, and now
on stony ground, never before had he seemed
so w^onderful a companion. He told me little stories ;
he began a hundred, and finished none ; yet with
the stars above us, they seemed a string of beads
all of bright colours. We stood still in the vast dark-
ness, while he whistled that strangest of all old songs
‚Äî ‚Äòthe Song the Sirens^ sang.‚Äô He pilfered my wits
and talked like my^double. But when ‚Äî how much
too quickly, I thought with sinking heart ‚Äî ^we were</p>
<p>THE ALMOND TREE II</p>
<p>come to the house-gates, he suddenly fell silent,
turned an instant, and stared far away over the
windy heath,</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòHow weary, stale, flat &rsquo; he began, and broke</p>
<p>oflF between uneasy laughter and a sigh, ‚ÄòListen to
me, Nicholas,‚Äô he said, lifting my face to the star-
light, ‚Äòyou must grow up a man ‚Äî a Man, you under-
stand ; no vapourings, no posings, no caprices ; and
above all, no sham. No sham. It‚Äôs your one and only
chance in this unfaltering Scheme,‚Äô He scanned my
face long and closely, ‚ÄòYou have your mother‚Äôs
eyes,‚Äô he said musingly, ‚ÄòAnd that,‚Äô he added under
his breath, &lsquo;&rsquo;thafs no joke,‚Äô He pushed open the
squealing gate, and we went in,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy mother was sitting in a low chair before a
dying and cheerless fire,</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòWell, Nick,‚Äô she said very suavely, ‚Äòand how
have you enjoyed your evening ?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúI stared at her without answer, ‚Äò Did you play
cards with the gentlemen ; or did you turn over the
music ?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòI talked to Miss Grey,‚Äô I said.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚Äò Really,‚Äô said my mother, raising her eyebrows,
‚Äòand who then is Miss Grey ?‚Äô My father was smiling
at us with sparkling eyes.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòMr. Grey‚Äôs sister,‚Äô I answered in a low voice.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòNot his wife, then ?‚Äô said my mother, glancing
furtivclv at the fire. I looked towards my father in
doubt, but could lift my eyes no higher than his knees .</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòYou little fool !‚Äô he said to my mother with a
laugh, ‚Äòwhat a sharpshooter 1 Never mind. Sir
Nick ; there, tun off to bed, my man,‚Äô</p>
<p>12 THE ALMOND TREE</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy mother caught me roughly by the sleeve as
I was passing her chair. ‚ÄòAren‚Äôt you going to kiss
me good-night, then,‚Äô she said furiously, her narrow
under-lip quivering, ‚Äòyou too !‚Äô I kissed her cheek.
‚ÄòThat‚Äôs tight, my dear,‚Äô she said scornfully, ‚Äòthat‚Äôs
how little fishes kiss.‚Äô She rose and drew back her
skirts. T refuse to stay in the room,‚Äô she said
haughtily, and with a sob she hurried out.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy father continued to smile, but only a smile
it seemed gravity had forgotten to smooth away.
He stood very still, so still that I grew afraid he must
certainly hear me thinking. Then with a kind of sigh
he sat down at my mother‚Äôs writing table, and
scribbled a few words with his pencil on a slip of
paper.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòThere, Nicholas, just tap at your mother‚Äôs door
with that. Good-night, old fellow‚Äô ; he took my hand
and smiled down into my eyes with a kind of gener-
ous dark appeal that called me straight to his side.
I hastened conceitedly upstairs, and delivered my
message. My mother was crying when she opened
the door.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòWell ?‚Äô she said in a low, trembling voice.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut presently afterwards, while I was still linger-
ing in the dark corridor, I heard her run down
quickly, and in a while my father and mother came
upstairs together, arm in arm, and by her light talk
and laughter you might suppose she had no know-
ledge of care or trouble at all.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNever afterwards did I see so much gaiety and
youthftilness in my mother‚Äôs face as when she sat
next morning with us at breakfast. The honeycomb.</p>
<p>THE ALMOND TREE</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>the small bronze chrysanthemums, her yeUow gown
seemed dainty as a miniature. With every word her
eyes would glance covertly at my father ; her smile,
as it were, hesitating between her lashes. She was
so light and girlish and so versatile I should scarcely
have #ecognised the weary and sallow face of the
night before. My father seemed to find as much
pleasure, or relief, in her good spirits as I did ; and
to delight in exercising his ingenuity to quicken her
humour.</p>
<p>Itwas but a transient morning of sunshine, however,
and as the brief and sombre day waned, its gloom
pervaded the house. In the evening my father left
us to our solitude as usual. And that night was very
misty over the heath, with a small, warm rain falling.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo it happened that I began to be left more and
more to my own devices, and grew so inured at last
to my own narrow company and small thoughts and
cares, that I began to look on my mother‚Äôs un-
happiness almost with indifference, and learned to
criticise almost before I had learned to pity. And
so I do not think I enjoyed Christmas very much the
less, although my father was away from home and
all our little festivities were dispirited. I had plenty
of good things to eat, and presents, and a picture-
book from Martha. I had a new rocking-horse ‚Äî
how changeless and impassive its motded battered
face looks out at me across the years 1 It was brisk,
clear weather, and on St. Stephen‚Äôs Day I went to
see if there was any ice yet on the Miller‚Äôs Pool.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI was stooping down at the extreme edge of the
pool, snapping the brittle splinters of the ice with</p>
<p>14 THE ALMOND TREE</p>
<p>my finger, when I heard a voice calling me in the
atul air. It was Jane Grey, walking on the heath with
my father, who had called me, having seen me from
a distance stooping beside the water.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòSo you see I have kept my promise,‚Äô she said,
taking my hand.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòBut you promised to come by yourself,‚Äô I said.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòWell, so I will then,‚Äô she answered, nodding
her head. ‚ÄòGood-bye,‚Äô she added, turning to my
father. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs three‚Äôs none, you see. Nicholas shall
take me home to tea, and you can rail for him in the
evening, if you will ; that is, if you are coming.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòAre you asking me to come ?‚Äô he said moodily,
‚Äòdo you care whether I come or not ?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe lifted her face and spoke gravely. ‚ÄòYou
are my friend,‚Äô she said, ‚Äòof course I care whether you
are with me or not.‚Äô He scrutinised her through
half-closed lids. His face was haggard, gloomy
with ennui. ‚ÄòHow you harp on the word, you
punctilious Jane. Do you suppose I am stiU in my</p>
<p>teens ? Twenty years ago, now It amuses me</p>
<p>to hear you women talk. It‚Äôs little you ever really
feel.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt think I am quite without feeling,‚Äô she
replied, ‚Äòyou are a little difficult, you know.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòDifficult,‚Äô he echoed in derision. He checked
himself and shrugged his shoulders. ‚ÄòYou see, Jane,
it‚Äôs all on the surface ; I boast of my indifference.
It‚Äôs the one rag of philosophy age denies no one.
It is so easy to be heroic ‚Äî debonair, iron-grey, fluent,
. dramatic ‚Äî you know it‚Äôs captivation, perhaps ? But
after all, life‚Äôs comedy, when one stops smiling, is</p>
<p>THE ALMOND TREE IJ</p>
<p>only the tcpidest farce. Or the gilt wears off and the
pinchbeck tragedy shows through. And so, as I say,
we talk on, being past fceliug. One by one our hopes
come home to roost, our delusions find themselves
out, and the mystery proves to be nothing but
slcight-of-hand. It‚Äôs age, my dear Jane ‚Äî age ; it
turns one to stone. With you young people life‚Äôs
a .dream ; ask Nicholas here 1‚Äô He shrugged his
shoulders, adding under his breath, ‚ÄòBut one wakes
on a devilish hard pallet.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòOf course,‚Äô said Jane slowly, ‚Äòyou are only
talking cleverly, and then it docs not matter whether
it‚Äôs true or not, I suppose. I can‚Äôt say. I don‚Äôt think
you mean it, and so it comes to nothing. I can‚Äôt
and won‚Äôt believe you feel so little ‚Äî I can‚Äôt.‚Äô She con-
tinued to smile, yet, I fancied, with the brightness of
tears in her eyes. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs all mockery and make-believe ;
we are not the miserable slaves of time you try to
fancy. There must be some way to win through.‚Äô
She turned away, then added slowly, ‚ÄòYou ask me
to be fearless, sincere, to speak my heart ; I wonder,
do you ?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy father did not look at her, appeared not to
have seen the hand she had half held out to him,
and as swiftly withdrawn. ‚ÄòThe truth is, Jane,‚Äô
he said slowly, ‚ÄòI am past sincerity now. And as
for heart it is a quite discredited organ at forty.
Life, thought, selfishness, egotism, call it what you
will ; they have all done their worst with me ; and I
really haven‚Äôt the sentiment to pretend that they
haven‚Äôt. And when bright youth and sentiment ate
gone ; why, go too, dear lady 1 Existence proves</p>
<p>l6 THE ALMOND TREE</p>
<p>nothing but brazen inanity afterwards. But there‚Äôs
always that turning left to the dullest and dustiest
toad ‚Äî oblivion.‚Äô He remained silent a moment.
Silence deep and strange lay aU around us. The air
was still, the wintry sky unutterably calm. And
again that low dispassionate voice continued : ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs
only when right seems too easy a thing, too trivial,
and not worm the doing ; and wrong a foolish thing
‚Äî too dull . . . There, take care of her, Nicholas ;
take care of her, ‚Äúsnips and snails,‚Äù you know. Au
revoir, ‚Äôpon my word, I almost wish it v^as good-bye.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúJane Grey regarded him attentively. ‚ÄòSo then
do I,‚Äô she replied in a low voice, ‚Äòfor I shall never
understand you ; perhaps I should hate to under-
stand you.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy father turned with an affected laugh, and
left us.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMiss Grey and I walked slowly along beside
the frosty bidrushes until we came to the wood.
The bracken and heather were faded. The earth
was dark and rich with autumnal rains. Fir-cones
lay on the moss beneath the dark green branches.
It was all now utterly silent in the wintry afternoon.
Far away rose tardily, and alighted, the hoarse
rooks upon the ploughed earth ; high in the pale
sky passed a few on ragged wing.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòWhat does my father mean by wishing it was
good-bye ?‚Äô I said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut my companion did not answer me in words.
She clasped my hand ; she seemed very slim and
gracious walking by my side on the hardened ground.
My mother was small now and awkward beside her</p>
<p>THE ALMOND TREE 17</p>
<p>in my imagination. I cjucstioned her about the ice,
about the red sky, and if there was any mistletoe in
the woods. Sometimes she, in turn, asked me ques-
tions too, and when I answered them we would look
at each other and smile, and it seemed it was with her
as it was with me ‚Äî of the pure gladness I found in her
company. In the nuddle of our walk to the Thorns
she bent down in the cold twilight, and putting her
hands on my shoulders, ‚ÄòMy dear, dear Nicholas,‚Äô
she said, ‚Äòyou must be a good son to your mother ‚Äî
brave and kind ; will you ?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòHe hardly ever speaks to mother now,‚Äô I
answered instinctively.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe pressed her lips to my cheek, and her cheek
was cold against mine, and she clasped her arms
about me. ‚ÄòKiss me,‚Äô she said. ‚ÄòWe must do our
best, mustn‚Äôt we ?‚Äô she pleaded, still holding me. I
looked mournfully into the gathering darkness,
‚ÄòThat‚Äôs easy when you‚Äôre grown up,‚Äô I said. She
laughed and kissed me again, and then we took hands
and ran till we were out of breath, towards the
distant lights of the Thorns. . . .</p>
<p>‚ÄúI had been some time in bed, lying awake in
the warmth, when my mother came softly through
the darkness into my room. She sat down at the
bedside, breathing hurriedly. ‚ÄòWhere have you
been all the evening ?‚Äô she said.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòMiss Grey asked me to stay to tea,‚Äô I answered.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòDid I give you permission to go to tea with
Miss Grey ?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúI made no answer.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòIf you go to that house again, I shall beat you.</p>
<p>l8 THE ALMOND TREE</p>
<p>You hear me, Nicholas ? Alone, or with your father,
if you go there again, without my permission, I shall
beat you. You have not been whipped for a long
time, have you ?‚Äô I could not see her face, but her
head was bent towards me in the dark, as she sat ‚Äî
almost crouched ‚Äî on my bedside.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI made no answer. But when my mother had
gone, without kissing me, I cried noiselessly on in to
my pillow. Something had suddenly flown out of
memory, never to sing again. Life had become
a little colder and stranger. 1 had always &lsquo;been
my own chief company ; now another sentimental
barrier had arisen between the world and me, past
its heedlessness, past my understanding to break
down.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHardly a week passed now without some bitter
quarrel. I seemed ever to be stealing out of sound of
angry voices ; ever fearful of being made the butt of
my father‚Äôs serene taunts, of my mother‚Äôs passions
and desperate remorse. He disdained to defend
himself against her, never reasoned with her ; he
merely shrugged his shoulders, denied her charges,
ignored her anger ; coldly endeavouring only to
show his indifierence, to conceal by every means in
his power his own inward weariness and vexation.
I saw this, of course, only vaguely, yet with all a
child‚Äôs certainty of insight, though I rarely knew the
cause of my misery ; and I continued to love them
both in my selfish fashion, not a whit the less.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAt last, on St. Valentine‚Äôs Day, things came to a
worse pass than before. It had always been my
father‚Äôs custom to hang my mother a valentine on</p>
<p>THE ALMOND TREE I9</p>
<p>the handle of her little parlour door, a string of
pearls, a fan, a book of poetry, whatever it might be.
She came down early this morning, and sat in the
window-seat, looking out at the failing snow. She
said nothing at breaMast, only feigned to eat, lifting
her eyes at intervals to glance at my father with a
strange intensity, as if of hatred, tapping her foot on
the floor. He took no notice of her, sat quiet and
moody with his own thoughts. I think he had not
really forgotten the day, for I found long afterwards
in his old bureau a bracelet purchased but a week
before with her name written on a scrap of paper,
inside the case. Yet it seemed to be the absence of
this little gift that had driven my mother beyond
reason.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTowards evening, tired of the house, tired of
being alone, I went out and played awhile listlessly
in the snow. At nightfall I went in ; and in the dark
heard angry voices. My father came out of the
dining-room and looked at me in silence, standing in
the gloom of the wintry dusk. My mother followed
him. I can see her now, leaning in the doorway,
white with rage, her eyes ringed and darkened with
continuous trouble, her hand trembling.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòIt shall learn to hate you,‚Äô she cried in a low,
dull voice. ‚ÄòI will teach it every moment to hate</p>
<p>and despise you as I Oh, I hate and despise</p>
<p>you.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy father looked at her calmly and profoundly
before replying. He took up a cloth hat and brushed
it with his hand. ‚ÄòVery well then, you have chosen,‚Äô
he said coldly. ‚ÄòIt has always lain with you. You</p>
<p>20 THE ALMOND TREE</p>
<p>have exaggerated, you have raved, and now you have
said what can never be recalled or forgotten. Here‚Äôs
Nicholas. Pray do not imagine, however, that I am
defending myself. I have nothing to defend. I think
of no one but myself ‚Äî no one. Endeavour to under-
stand me, no one. Perhaps, indeed, you yourself ‚Äî
no more than ‚Äî . But words again ‚Äî the dull old.
round !‚Äô He made a peculiar gesture with his hand.
‚ÄòWell, life is . . . ach ! I have done. So be it.‚Äô He
stood looking out of the door. ‚ÄòYou see, it‚Äôs
snowing,‚Äô he said, as if to himself.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll the long night before and all day long, snow
had been falling continuously. The air was wintry
and cold. I could discern nothing beyond the porch
but a gloomy accumulation of cloud in the twilight
air, now darkened with the labyrinthine motion of
the snow. My father glanced back for an instant into
the house, and, as I fancy, regarded me with a kind
of strange, close earnestness. But he went out and
his footsteps were instantly silenced.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy mother peered at me in terrible perplexity,
her eyes wide with terror and remorse. ‚ÄòWhat?
What ?‚Äô she said. I stared at her stupidly. Three
snowflakes swiftly and airily floated together into
the dim hall from the gloom without. She clasped
her hand over her mouth. Overburdened her fingers
seemed to be, so slender were they, with her many
rings.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòNicholas, Nicholas, tell me ; what was I saying ?
What was I saying ?‚Äô She stumbled hastily to the
door. ‚ÄòArthur, Arthur,‚Äô she cried from the porch,
‚Äòit‚Äôs St. Valentine‚Äôs Day, that was all I meant ; come</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>THE AEMOND TREE</p>
<p>back, come back !‚Äô But perhaps my father was
already out of hearing ; I do not think he made any
reply.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy mother came in doubtfully, resting her hand
on the wall. And she walked very slowly and
laboriously upstairs. While I was standing at the
. foot of the staircase, looking out across the haU into
the. evening, Martha climbed primly up from the
kitchen with her lighted taper, shut-to the door and
lit the hall lamp. Already the good smell of the feast
cooking floated up from the kitchen, and gladdened
my spirits. ‚ÄòWill he come back ?‚Äô Martha said,
looking very scared in the light of her taper. ‚Äò It&rsquo;s
such a fall of snow, already it‚Äôs a hand‚Äôs breadth on
the window-sill. Oh, Master Nicholas, it‚Äôs a hard
world for us women.‚Äô She followed my mother
upstairs, carrying light to all the gloomy upper
rooms.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI sat down in the window-seat of the dining-
room, and read in my picture-book as well as I could
by the flame-light. By-and-by, Martha returned to
lay the table.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs far back as brief memory carried me, it had
been our custom to make a Valentine‚Äôs feast on the
Saint‚Äôs day. This was my father‚Äôs mother‚Äôs birthday
also. When she was alive I well remember her
visiting us with her companion. Miss Schreiner,
who talked in such good-humoured English to me.
This same anniversary had last year brought about
a tender reconciliation between my father and
mother, after a quarrel that meant how little then.
And I remember on this day to have seen the first</p>
<p>2Z THB ALMOND TREB</p>
<p>fast-scaled buds upon the almond tree. We would
have a great spangled cake in the middle of the table,
with marzipan and comfits, just as at Christmastide.
And when Mrs. Merry lived in the village her little
fair daughters used to come in a big carriage to
spend the evening with us and to share my Valentine‚Äôs
feast.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut all this was changed now. My wits were
sharper, but I was none the less only the duller for
that ; my hopes and dreams had a little fallen and
faded. I looked idly at my picture-bock, vaguely
conscious that its colours pleased me less than once
upon a time ; that I was rather tired of seeing them,
and they just as tired of seeing me. And yet I had
no thin g else to do, so I must go on with a hard face,
turning listlessly the pictured pages.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAbout seven o‚Äôclock my mother sent for me. I
found her sitting in her bedroom. Candles were
burning before the looking-glass. She was already
dressed in her handsome black silk gown, and wear-
ing her pearl necklace. She began to brush my hair,
curling its longer ends with her fingers, which she
moistened in the pink bowl that was one of the first
things I had set eyes on in this world. She put .me
on a clean blouse and my buckle shoes, talking to
me the while, almost as if she were telling me a story.
Then she looked at herself long and earnestly in the
glass ; throwing up her chin with a smile, as was a
habit of hers in talk. I wandered about the room,
fingering the little toilet-boxes and nick-nacks on the
table. By mischance I upset one of these, a scent-
bottle that held rose-water. The water ran out and</p>
<p>THE ALMOND TREE 2 }</p>
<p>filled the warm air with its fragrance. ‚ÄòYou foolish,
clumsy boy 1‚Äô said my mother, and slapped my hand.
More out of vexation and tiredness than because of the
pain, I began to cry. And then, with infinite tender-
ness, she leaned her head on my shoulder. ‚ÄòMother
can‚Äôt think very well just now,‚Äô she said ; and cried
so bitterly in silence that I was only too ready to
&rsquo;extricate myself and run away when her hold on me
relaxed.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI climbed slowly upstairs to Martha‚Äôs bedroom,
and kneeling on a cane chair looked out of the win-
dow. The flakes had ceased to fall now, although the
snowy heath was encompassed in mist ; above the
snow the clouds had parted, drifting from beneath
the stars, and these in their constellations were trem-
bling very brightly, and here and there burned one of
them in solitude larger and wilder in its shining than
the rest. But though I did not tire of looking out
of the window, my knees began to ache ; and the
little room was very cold and still so near the roof.
So I went down to the dining-room, with all its seven
candlesticks kindled, seeming to my unaccustomed
eyes a very splendid blaze out of the dark. My mother
was kneeling on the rug by the fireside. She looked
very small, even dwarfish, I thought. She was gazing
into the flames ; one shoe curved beneath the hem
of her gown, her chin resting on her hand.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI surveyed the table with its jellies and sweet-
meats and glasses and fruit, and began to be very
hungry, so savoury was the smell of the turkey
roasting downstairs. Martha knocked at the door
when t¬£e clock had struck eight.</p>
<p>24 THE ALMOND TREE</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòDinner is ready. Ma‚Äôam.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy mother glanced fleetingly at the clock.
‚ÄòJust a little, only a very little while longer, tell
Mrs. Ryder ; your master will be home in a minute.‚Äô
She rose and placed the claret in the hearth at some
distance from the fire.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòIs it nicer warm, mother ?‚Äô I said. She looked
at me with startled eyes and nodded. ‚ÄòDid you hear
any thing, Nicholas ? Run to the door and listen ;
was that a sound of footsteps ?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúI opened the outer door and peered into the
darkness ; but it seemed the world ended here with
the warmth and the Hght : beyond could extend
only winter and silence, a region that, familiar
though it was to me, seemed now to terrify me like
an enormous sea.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs stopped snowing,‚Äô I said, ‚Äòbut there isn‚Äôt
anybody there ; nobody at all, mother.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe hours passed heavily from quarter on to
quarter. The turkey, I grieved to hear, was to be
taken out of the oven, and put away to cool in the
pantry. I was bidden help myself to what I pleased of
the trembling jellies, and delicious pink blanc-mange.
Already midnight would be the next hour to be
chimed. I felt sick, yet was still hungry and very
tired. The candles began to burn low. ‚ÄòLeave me a
little light here, then,‚Äô my mother said at last to
Martha, ‚Äòand go to bed. Perhaps your master has
missed his way home in the snow.‚Äô But Mrs. Ryder
had followed Martha into the room.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòYou must pardon my interference. Ma‚Äôam, but
it isn‚Äôt right, it isn‚Äôt really right of you to sit up</p>
<p>THE ALMOND TREE 2J</p>
<p>longer. Master will not come back, maybe, before
morning. And I shouldn‚Äôt be doing my bounden
duty. Ma‚Äôam, except I spoke my mind. Just now
too, of aU times.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòThank you very much, Mrs. Ryder,‚Äô my mother
answered simply, ‚Äòbut I would prefer not to go to
^bed yet. It‚Äôs very lonely on the heath at night. But
I shall not want anything else, thank you.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòWell, Ma‚Äôam, I‚Äôve had my say, and done my
conscience‚Äôs bidding. And I have brought you up
this tumbler of mulled wine ; else you‚Äôll be sinking
away or something with the fatigue.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy mother took the wine, sipped of it with a wan
smUc at Mrs. Ryder over the brim ; and Mrs. Ryder
retired with Martha. I don‚Äôt think they had noticed
me sitting close in the shadow on my stool beside
the table. But all through that long night, I fancy,
these good souls took it in turn to creep down
stealthily and look in on us ; and in the small hours
of the morning, when the fire had fallen low, they
must have wrapped us both warm in shawls. They
left me then, I think, to be my mother‚Äôs company.
Indeed, I remember we spoke in the darkness, and
she took my hand.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy mother and I shared the steaming wine
together when they were gone ; our shadows looming
faintly huge upon the ceiling. We said very little,
but I looked softly into her grey childish eyes, and
we kissed one another kneeling there together before
the fire. And afterwards, I jigged softly round the
table, pilfering whatever sweet or savoury mouthful
took my fancy. But by-and-by in the silent house ‚Äî</p>
<p>i6 THE ALMOND TREE</p>
<p>a silence broken only by the Buttering of the Barnes,
and the odd far-away sfir of the frost, drowsiness
vanquished me ; I sat down by the fireside, leaning
my head on a chair. And sitting thus, vaguely eyeing
firelight and wavering shadow, I began to nod, and
very soon dream stalked in, mingling with reality.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt was early morning when I awoke, dazed and-
cold and miserable in my uncomfortable resting-
place. The rare odour of frost was on the air. The
ashes of the fire lay iron-grey upon rhe cold hearth.
An intensely clear white ray of light leaned up
through a cranny of the shutters to the cornice of
the ceiling. I got up with difficulty. My mother was
still asleep, breathing heavily, and as I stooped,
regarding her curiously, I could almost watch her
transient dreams fleeting over her face ; and now she
smiled faintly ; and now she raised her eyebrows as
if in some playful and happy talk with my father ;
then again utterly still darkness would descend on
brow and lid and lip.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI touched her sleeve, suddenly conscious of my
loneliness in the large house. Her face clouded
instantly ; she sighed profoundly : ‚ÄòW hat ?* she
said, ‚Äònothing ‚Äî nothing?‚Äô She stretched out her hand
towards me ; the lids drew back from eyes still blind
from sleep. But gradually time regained its influence
over her. She moistened her lips and turned to me,
and suddenly, in a gush of agony, remembrance of
the night returned to her. She hid her face in her
hands, rocking her body gently to and fro ; then
rose and smoothed back her hair at the looking-
glass. I was surprised to see no trace of tears on her</p>
<p>THE ALMOND TREE 2/</p>
<p>cheeks. Her lips moved, as if unconsciously a heart
worn out with grief addressed that pale reflection of
her sorrow in the glass. I took hold of the hand that
hung down listlessly on her silk skirt, and fondled it,
kissing punctiliously each loose ring in turn.</p>
<p>‚Äò^But I do not think she heeded my kisses. So I
.returned to the table on which was still set out the
mockery of our Valentine feast, strangely disen-
chanted in the chill dusk of daybreak. I put a
handful of wine biscuits and a broken piece of cake
in my pocket ; for a determination had taken me
to go out on to the heath. My heart beat thick and
fast in imagination of the solitary snow and of myself
wandering in loneliness across its untrampled surface.
A project also was forming in my mind of walking
over to the Thorns ; for somehow I knew my mother
would not scold or punish me that day. Perhaps, I
thought, my father would be there. And I would tell
Miss Grey all about my adventure of the night spent
down in the dining-room. So moving very stealthily,
and betraying no eagerness, lest I should be for-
bidden to go, I stole at length unperceived from the
room, and leaving the great hall door ajar, ran out
joyously into the wintry morning.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAlready dawn was clear and high in the sky,
already the first breezes were moving in the mists ;
and breathed chill, as if it were the lingering dark-
ness itself on my cheeks. The air was cold, yet with
a fresh faint sweetness. The snow lay crisp across
its perfect surface, mounded softly over the gorse-
bushes, though here and there a spray of parched
blossom yet protruded from its cowl. Flaky particles</p>
<p>28 THE ALMOND TREE</p>
<p>of ice floated invisible in the air. I called out with
aleasure to see the little ponds where the snow had
seen blown away from the black ice. I saw on the
rushes too the webs of spiders stretched from thorn
to thorn, and festooned with crystals of hoar-frost.</p>
<p>I turned and counted as far as I could my footsteps
leading back to the house, which lay roofed ia.,^
gloomy pallor, dim and obscured in the darkened
west,</p>
<p>‚ÄúA waning moon that had risen late in the night
shone, it seemed, very near to the earth. But every
moment light swept invincibly in, pouring its crystd
like a river ; and darkness sullenly withdrew into the
north. And when at last the sun appeared, glittering
along the rosy snow, I turned in an ecstasy and with
my finger pointed him out, as if the house I had left
behind me might view him with my own delight.
Indeed, I saw its windows transmuted, and heard
afar a thrush pealing in the bare branches of a
pear-tree ; and a robin startled me, so suddenly
shrill and sweet he broke into song from a snowy
tuft of gorsc,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI was now come to the beginning of a gradual
incline, from the summit of which I should presently
descry in the distance the avenue of lindens that led
towards the village from the margin of the heath.
As I went on my way, munching my biscuits, looking
gaily about me, I brooded dehciously on the break-
fast which Miss Grey would doubtless sit me down
to ; and almost forgot the occasion of my errand,
and the troubled house I had left behind me. At
length I climbed to the top of the smooth ridge and</p>
<p>THE ALMOND TREE</p>
<p>looked down. At a little distance from me grew a
crimson hawthorn-tree that often in past Aprils I
had used for a green tent from the showers ; but
now it was closely hooded, darkening with its faint
shadow the long expanse of unshadowed whiteness.
Not very far from this bush I perceived a figure
lying stretched along the snow and knew instinc-
tively that this was my father lying here.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe sight did not then surprise or dismay me.
It seemed but the lucid sequel to that long heavy
night-watch, to all the troubles and perplexities
of the past. I felt no sorrow, but stood beside the
body, regarding it only with deep wonder and a kind
of earnest curiosity, yet perhaps with a remote pity
too, that he could not see me in the beautiful morn-
ing. His grey hand lay arched in the snow, his
darkened face, on which showed a smear of dried
blood, was turned away a little as if out of the oblique
sunshine. I understood that he was dead, was already
loosely speculating on what changes it would make ;
how I should spend my time ; what would happen
in the house now that he was gone, his influence,
his authority, his discord. I remembered too that
I was alone, was master of this immense secret,
that I must go home sedately, as if it were a Sunday,
and in a low voice tcU my mother, concealing any
exultation I might feel in the office. I imagined
the questions that would be asked me, and was
considering the proper answers to make to them,
when my morbid dreams were suddenly broken in
on by Martha Rodd. She stood in my footsteps,
looking down on me from the ridge from which I</p>
<p>JO THE ALMOND TEEE</p>
<p>had but just now descended. She hastened towards
me, stooping a little as if she carried a burden, her
mouth ajar, her forehead wrinkled beneath its
wispy light brown hair.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòLook, Martha, look,‚Äô I cried, ‚ÄòI found him in
the snow ; he‚Äôs dead.‚Äô And suddenly a bond seemed
to snap in my heart. The beauty and solitude of the
morning, the perfect whiteness of the snow ‚Äî it was
all an uncouth mockery against me ‚Äî a subtle and
quiet treachery. The tears gushed irto my eyes and
in my fear and affliction I clung to the poor girl,
sobbing bitterly, protesting my grief, hiding my eyes
in terror from Aat still, inscrutable shape. She
smoothed my hair with her hand again and again,
her eyes fixed ; and then at last, venturing cautiously
nearer, she stooped over my father. ‚ÄòO Master
Nicholas,‚Äô she said, ‚Äòhis poor dark hair ! What will
we do now ? What will your poor mamma do now,
and him gone ?‚Äô She hid her face in her hands, and
our tears gushed out anew.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut my grief was speedily forgotten. The
novelty of being left entirely alone, my own master ;
to go where I would ; to do as I pleased ; the ex-
perience of being pitied most when I least needed it,
and then ‚Äî ^when misery and solitariness came over
me like a cloud ‚Äî of being utterly ignored, turned my
thoughts gradually away. My father‚Äôs body was
brought home and laid in my mother‚Äôs little parlour
that looked out on to the garden and the snowy
orchard. The house was darkened. I took a secret
pleasure in peeping in on the sunless rooms, and
stealing from door to door through corridors</p>
<p>THE ALMOND TREE 3I</p>
<p>screened from the daylight. My mother was ill ;
and for some inexplicable reason I connected her
illness with the bevy of gentlemen dressed in black
who came one morning to the house and walked
away together over the heath. Finally Mrs. Mar-
shall drove up one afternoon from Islington, and
hy the bundles she had brought with her and her
grained box with the iron handles I knew that she
was come, as once before in my experience, to stay.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI was playing on the morrow in the hall with
my leaden soldiers when there came into my mind
vaguely the voices of Mrs. Ryder and of Mrs. Mar-
shall gossiping together on their tedious way upstairs
from the kitchen.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòNo, Mrs. Marshall, nothing,‚Äô I heard Mrs. Ryder
saying, ‚Äònot one word, not one word. And now the
poor dear lady left quite alone, and only the doctor
to gainsay that fatherless mite from facing the idle
inquisitive questions of all them strangers. It‚Äôs
neither for me nor you, Mrs. Marshall, to speak out
just what comes into our heads here and now. The
ways of the Almighty are past understanding ‚Äî but
a kinder at heart never trod this earth.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòAh,‚Äô said Mrs. Marshall.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòI knew to my sorrow,‚Äô continued Mrs. Ryder,
‚Äòthere was words in the house ; but there, whereso-
ever you be there‚Äôs that. Human beings ain‚Äôt angels,
married or single, and in every ‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòWasn‚Äôt there talk of some ?‚Äô insinuated</p>
<p>Mrs. Marshall discreetly.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòTalk, Mrs. Marshall,‚Äô said Mrs. Ryder, coming
to a standstill, ‚ÄòI scorn the word I A pinch of</p>
<p>32 THE ALMOND TREE</p>
<p>truth in a hogshead of falsehood. I don‚Äôt gainsay it
even. I just shut my ears ‚Äî there ‚Äî with the dead.‚Äô
Mrs. Marshall had opened her mouth to reply when
I was discovered, crouched as small as possible at
the foot of the stairs.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòWell, here‚Äôs pitchers !‚Äô said Mrs. Marshall
pleasantly, ‚ÄòAnd this is the poor fatherless mani-
kin, I suppose. It‚Äôs hard on the innocent, Mrs.
Ryder, and him grown such a sturdy child too, as I
said from the first. Well, now, and don‚Äôt you re-
member me, little man, don‚Äôt you remember Mrs.
Marshall ? He ought to, now !‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs a very good boy in general,‚Äô said Mrs.
Ryder, ‚Äòand I‚Äôm sure I hope and pray he‚Äôll grow up
to be a comfort to his poor widowed mother, if so</p>
<p>be ‚Äô They glanced earnestly at one another,</p>
<p>and Mrs. Marshall stooped with a sigh of effort and
drew a big leather purse from a big loose pocket
under her skirt, and selected a bright ha‚Äôpeimy from
among its silver and copper.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòI make no doubt he will, poor mite,‚Äô she said
cheerfully ; I took the ha‚Äôpenny in silence and the
two women passed slowly upstairs.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn the afternoon, in order to be beyond call of
Martha, I went out on to the heath with a shovel,
intent on building a great tomb in the snow. Yet
more snow had fallen during the night ; it now lay
so deep as to covet my socks above my shoes. I
laboured very busily, shovelling, beating, moulding,
stamping. So intent was I that I did not see Miss
Grey until she was close beside me. I looked up from
the snow and was surprised to find the sun already</p>
<p>THE ALMOND TREE 55</p>
<p>set and the low mists of evening approaching. Miss
Grey was veiled and dressed in furs to the throat.
She drew her ungloved hand from her muff.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòNicholas,‚Äô she said in a low voice.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI stood for some reason confused and ashamed
without answering her. She sat down on ray shape-
less moimd of snow, and took me by the hand. Then
she drew up her veil, and I saw her face pale and
darkened, and her dark eyes gravely lookinginto mine.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòMy poor, poor Nicholas,‚Äô she said, and con-
tinued to gaze at me with her warm hand clasping
mine. ‚ÄòWhat can I say ? What can I do ? Isn‚Äôt it
very, very lonely out here in the snow ?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt feel lonely much,‚Äô I answered, ‚ÄòI was
making a ‚Äî I was playing at budding.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòAnd I am sitting on your beautiful snow-house,
then ?‚Äô she said, smiling sadly, her hand trembling
upon mine.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòIt isn‚Äôt a house,‚Äô I answered, turning away.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe pressed my hand on the furs at her throat.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòPoor cold, blue hands,‚Äô she said. ‚ÄòDo you like
playing alone ?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòI like you being here,‚Äô I answered. ‚ÄòI wish
you would come always, or at least sometimes.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe drew me close to her, smiling, and bent and
kissed my head.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòThere,‚Äô she said, ‚ÄòI am here now.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòMother‚Äôs ill,‚Äô I said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe drew back and looked out over the heath
towards the house.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòThey have put my father in the little parlour, in
his coffin ; of course, you know he‚Äôs dead, and Mrs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;HJB almond tree</p>
<p>Matshall&rsquo;s come; she gave me a ha&rsquo;penny this
morning. Dr. Graham gave me a whole crown,
though.‚Äô I took it out of my breeches pocket and
showed it her.</p>
<p>&quot; ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs very, very nice,‚Äô she said. What lots of
nice things you can buy with it ! And, look, I am
going to give you a little keepsake too, between
just you and me.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt was a small silver box that she drew out of
her muff, and embossed in the silver of the lid was
a crucifix. ‚ÄòI thought, perhaps, I should see you
to-day, you know,‚Äô she continued softly. ‚ÄòNow,
who‚Äôs given you this ?‚Äô she said, putting the box
into my hand.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòYou,‚Äô I answered softly.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòAnd who am I ?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòMiss Grey,‚Äô I said.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòYour friend, Jane Grey,‚Äô she repeated, as if
she were fond of her own name. ‚ÄòSay it now ‚Äî
always my friend, Jane Grey.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúI repeated it after her.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòAnd now,‚Äô she continued, ‚Äòtell me which room
is ‚Äî is the little parlour. Is it that small window at
the corner under the ivy ?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúI shook my head.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòWhich ?‚Äô she said in a whisper, after a long pause.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI twisted my shovel in the snow. ‚ÄòWould you
like to see my father ?‚Äô I said. ‚ÄòI am sure, you know,
Martha would not mind ; and mother‚Äôs in bed.‚Äô She
started, and looked with quiet, dark eyes into my
face. ‚ÄòWhere ?‚Äô she said, / without stirring.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs at the back, a littijC window that comes out</p>
<p>THE ALMOND TREE )S</p>
<p>‚Äî i¬£ you were to come this evening, I would be play-
ing in the hall ; I always play in the hall, after tea,
if I can ; and now, always. Nobody would see you
at all, you know.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe sighed. ‚ÄòO what are you saying?‚Äô she said,
and stood up, drawing down her veil.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòBut would you like to?‚Äô I repeated. She stooped
suddenly, pressing her veiled face to mine. ‚ÄòI‚Äôll come.
I‚Äôll come,‚Äô she said, her face utterly changed so close
to my eyes. We can both still ‚Äî still be loyal to him,
can‚Äôt we, Nicholas?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe walked away quickly, towards the pool and
the Mttle darkened wood. I looked after her and
knew that she would be waiting there alone till even-
ing. I looked at my silver box with great satisfaction,
and after opening it, put it into my pocket with my
crown piece and my ha‚Äôpenny, and continued my
building for awhile.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut now 2est for it was gone ; and I began to feel
cold, the frost closing in keenly as darkness gathered.
So I went home.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy silence and suspicious avoidance of scrutiny
and question passed unnoticed. Indeed, I ate my
tea in solitude, except that now and again one or
other of the women would come bustling in on some
brief errand. A peculiar suppressed stir was in the
house. I wondered what could be the cause of it ;
and felt a little timid and anxious of my project
being discovered.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNone the less I was playing in the evening, as I
had promised, close to fhe door, alert to catch the
faintest sign of the coming of my visitor.</p>
<p>36 THE ALMOND TREE</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòRun down in the kitchen, dearie,‚Äô said Martha.
Her cheeks were flushed. She was carrying a big can
of steaming water. ‚ÄòYou must keep very, very quiet
this evening and go to bed hke a good boy, and
perhaps to-morrow morning I‚Äôll ten you a great,
great secret.‚Äô She kissed me with hasty rapture.
I was not especially inquisitive of her secret just then,
and eagerly promised to be quite quiet if I might
continue to play where I was.</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòWell, very, very quiet then, and you mustn‚Äôt
let Mrs. Marshall,‚Äô she began, but hurried hastily
away in answer to a peremptory summons from
upstairs.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAlmost as soon as she was gone I heard a light
rap on the door. It seemed that Jane Grey brought in
with her the cold and freshness of the woods. I led
the way on tiptoe down the narrow corridor and into
the small, silent room. The candles burned pure
and steadfastly in their brightness. The air was still
and languid with the perfume of flowers. Overhead
passed light, heedful footsteps ; but they seemed
not a disturbing sound, only a rumour beyond the
bounds of silence.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòI am very sorry,‚Äô I said, ‚Äòbut they have nailed
it down, Martha says the men came this afternoon.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúMiss Grey took a little bunch of snowdrops from
her bosom, and hid them in among the clustered
wreaths of flowers ; and she knelt down on the floor,
with a little silver cross which she sometimes wore
pressed tight to her lips. I felt ill at ease to sec her
praying, and wished I could go back to my soldiers.
But while I watched her, seeing in marvellous</p>
<p>THE ALMOND TREE 37</p>
<p>brilliancy everything in the little room, and re-
membering dimly the snow lying beneath the stars
in the darlmess of the garden, I listened also to the
quiet footsteps passing to and fro in the room above.
Suddenly, the silence was broken by a small, con-
tinuous, angry crying.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMiss Grey looked up. Her eyes were very clear
and wonderful in the candlelight.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòWhat was that ?‚Äô she said faintly, listening.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI stared at her. The cry welled up anew, pite-
ously, as if of a small remote helpless indignation.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòWhy it sounds just like ‚Äî a little baby,‚Äô I said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe crossed herself hastily and arose. ‚ÄòNicholas!‚Äô
she said in a strange, quiet, bewildered voice ‚Äî yet
her face was most curiously bright. She looked at
me lovingly and yet so strangely I wished I had not
let her come in.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe went out as she had entered. I did not so
much as peep into the darkness after her, but busy
with a hundred thoughts returned to my play.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLong past my usual bed-time, as I sat sipping a
mug of hot milk before the glowing cinders of the
kitchen fire, Martha told me her secret. . . .</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo my impossible companion in the High Street
yesterday was own and only brother to your crazy old
friend, Richard,‚Äù said the Count. ‚ÄúHis only brother,‚Äù
he added, in a muse.</p>
<p>THE COUNT‚ÄôS COURTSHIP</p>
<p>I T had long been our custom to muse and gossip &rsquo;
through the summer evening twilight, and now
we had lingered so late that the dar&amp;iess of night
had come into the room. But two, at least, of the three
of us were well content so to moon on, the fitful
summer lightnings shining pale on our faces as we sat
at the window. As for myself, I can only confess that
with every tick of the clock I had been more and more
inclined to withdraw, and so give the others the
opportunity and ease of my absence. But likely
enough, had I done so, the Count would have bluffly
recalled me, or my aunt would have roused herself
from her reverie to candles and common sense
So I held my tongue, after my aunt‚Äôs example,
who sat, still and erect, looking out through her
glasses, her hands upon the arms of her chair, while
the Count spoke seldom, and that generally in a kind
of inarticulate discourse with himself.</p>
<p>There was plenty to busy my thoughts. The
Count was evidently on the point of abandoning his
long-cherished platonicism. My aunt, of late, had
been far from her usual self, now brisk, now apa-
thetic ; but neither and nothing for long together.
Matrimony was in the air, and I must soon be an
exile. Soon, doubtless, a wife (and how capable and
prudent a wife) would relieve me of my duties to my
eloquent, arbitrary old friend. I had become super-
fluous. The most amiable of chaperons now found
himself gradually converted into a tartish gooseberry.
The quick lightning had but just now ill umin ed the</p>
<p>THE count‚Äôs courtship 39</p>
<p>Count‚Äôs face as he bent towards her. In his eyes was
inspiration. And my aunt‚Äôs almost uncivil with-
drawal of her hand was evidently all but the last
capricious valedictory gesture to middle age and
widowhood.</p>
<p>My aunt apparently suddenly realized this, and
‚Ä¢the hazard of keeping silent. She rose abruptly,
smoothing out her silk skirts as if she had thought
to herself, ‚ÄúWeU, that‚Äôs done with.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI fear I was nodding. Count ; I beg pardon,‚Äù she
said in a rather faint voice, and behind the semblance
of a yawn. ‚ÄúThe air‚Äôs close and heavy. It seems a
storm‚Äôs gathering.‚Äù</p>
<p>We neither of us answered her.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRichard,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúoblige me by ringing the
bell.‚Äù</p>
<p>The Count deftly intercepted me.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a waste of peace and quietness,‚Äù said he
appealingly. ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt you sit but a few minutes
longer? Who knows : not so many days maybe left,
with such quiet ends ‚Äî the twilight, summer ?
Richard shall fetch you a shawl. We‚Äôll take a turn in
the garden.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúVery pretty sentiments. Count,‚Äù answered my
aunt, ‚Äúbut you must take pity on old bones. Up-
stairs must be my garden to-night. I‚Äôm tired and
drowsy ‚Äî it‚Äôs been a hot, dusty day ‚Äî and I think I‚Äôll
be getting to my rest while the thunder is out of
hearing.‚Äù</p>
<p>Soon candles gleamed on the wall ; the pensive
romantic twilight of evening was over. My aunt
turned her face slowly, even reluctantly, I fancied.</p>
<p>40 THE count‚Äôs courtship</p>
<p>into their radiance. She looked pale, tired ; and
seemed disturbed and perplexed.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think, Richard, I‚Äôd like your arm up the stairs.‚Äù
Again the Count forestalled me. ‚ÄòBless me. Count,‚Äù
said my aunt in shaken, almost querulous tones,
‚Äúyou‚Äôll be completely spoiling me with your ‚Äî your
kindness. I wouldn‚Äôt rob you of your peace and
quiet for all the world. There, Richard, that‚Äôs it.‚Äù</p>
<p>She leaned a little heavily on my arm, walking
slowly and deliberately. In the doorway she turned ;
hesitated.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd now, good-night, my dear Count,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>The Count stood, stark as a patriot, against the
wall. It was not to be ‚Äúroses all the way.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúGood-night, my dear lady,‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>^ As we slowly ascended the stairs I could hardly
refrain from gently taxing my aunt with what
seemed very like coquetry. Yet something in her
w^U had set me doubting. And as I now looked
si ^fe dg at her, I fancied I could detect a gravity in
H^lice which no mere feminine caprice could cause
or inrplain. At her bedroom door I handed her the
candle.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI wish you could have stayed a little,‚Äù I mum-
bled inanely ; ‚Äúhe really meant it, you know. I
ought to have realized that . . .‚Äù</p>
<p>She took the.candle, stafflg vacantly into my face
the while.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI should like to see you, Richard, in about ten
minutes‚Äô time,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúStep up cautiously to my
.room here. I shall be awaiting you. I want a few
minutes‚Äô quiet, sensible talk ‚Äî you understand ?‚Äù</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>THE count‚Äôs courtship</p>
<p>And with that she went in and shut the door.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRichard, Richard,‚Äù I heard the Count‚Äôs stealthy
whisper at the foot of the stairs ; but I made a clatter
with the door handle, pretending not to have heard ^</p>
<p>I sat in my bedroom speculating in vain what my
.aunt wanted with me.</p>
<p>In ten nunutes I tapped softly, and she herself
opened the door. She was attired in a voluminous
dressing-gown of scarlet flannel; her hair was loosely
plaited and looped up on her shoulders, with less of
grey in it than I had supposed. She shut the door
after me, and rather stiffly signed to me to sit down.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚ÄôU trouble you, please, to speak rather softly,
Richard,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúbecause my window is open for
air, and the Coitnt is walking in the garden.‚Äù She
seated herself on a stiff bedroom chair, clasping
her hands in her ample lap. I‚Äôve called you in, my*
boy, to tell you that I am going to leave here toi
morrow.‚Äù</p>
<p>I leaned forward to speak, but she peremptorily
waved me back. ‚ÄúJanet has ordered a cab for me ;
it will be at the door at eleven o‚Äôclock in the morning.
My trunks ‚Äî these two, just what I shall require ‚Äî
are packed and ready. Janet will see to the rest.</p>
<p>to me by the railw^^RpHle the end of the week.

<p>42 THE count‚Äôs COURTSHIP</p>
<p>out of the house. Don‚Äôt keep on opening your
mouth, Richard ; it distracts me. Then in some sort
of explanation you are to tell him that his hospitality
was so ‚Äî so congenial to me that I hadn‚Äôt the heart
nor the words either ‚Äî ^to say good-bye. Tell him
I‚Äôll write good-bye. &hellip; Is that perfectly clear,
now ?‚Äù</p>
<p>A languid breath of air gently lifted the white
blind, as if to cool the flush that had spread over
my aunt‚Äôs check. Her face was inscrutrble</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat address did you say for the boxes ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúBless the boy 1 send them home.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúVery well. Aunt Lucy,‚Äù I answered, and rose from
my chair. My axmt lifted her hand, and let it fall again
into her lap.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIs there anything else ?‚Äù I said.</p>
<p>The inscrutability of her expression angered and
bafiled me. She continued to look at me with an
open solemnity, but as if I were a hundred miles
away.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy do you pick and choose your words, make
such a pretence, Richard, when you might speak
out ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòPretence,‚Äô Aunt Lucy ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf an old woman came in such straits to me,and I
was a tolerably sensible young man like yourself, I
hope and trust I‚Äôd use my wits to better purpose. I
am in some anxiety. You see it. You are not blind.
But you are saying to yourself, in your conceit and
pique ‚Äî ‚ÄòI won‚Äôt ask her what it is.‚Äô You think‚Äî
‚ÄòI‚ÄôU wait for the old lady‚Äôs confession ; it‚Äôs bound to
come.‚Äô I ask you candidly, is that open and manly ?</p>
<p>THE count‚Äôs courtship 45</p>
<p>Is iiat the English frankness and chivalry we never
weary of boasting about? Do you suppose that
mere&rdquo; cleverness watched over your cradle ? Do you
(think mete cleverness will ever win you a wife?
Would ‚Äî would the Count ?‚Äù</p>
<p>% Colour once more had welled into her cheeks, and
per carpet-slippered foot was thrust impatiently out
from, beneath her dressing-gown.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI did not suppose you wished me to intrude,‚Äù I
stammered. ‚ÄúYou have your own reasons, I assume,
for ordering me about. I assume, you had your own
reasons, too, for not taking me into your confidence.
I am sorry. Aunt Lucy, but I don‚Äôt see what else I
could have done.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúSit down, Richard,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLook here. Aunt Lucy,‚Äù I interposed a little
hotly, ‚Äúyou ask me to speak out. You‚Äôve said a good
many things a fellow would resent pretty warmly
from ‚Äî any one else. Now let me have my say too.
And I can‚Äôt help it if I do offend you ; or if you think
I‚Äôm butting in on what doesn‚Äôt concern me. I say
this‚Äî it‚Äôs a mean, shabby thing to treat the Count like
this. You‚Äôve talked and walked with him. You
know what he thinks ‚Äî what he feels. He‚Äôs not the
unfeeling simpleton you think me. But |je can‚Äôt help
hoping. Now is it fair and square then to go off like this
behind his back ‚Äî because you daren‚Äôt meet him and
brave him to his face ?. He simply can‚Äôt help himself.
That‚Äôs the point. I‚Äôm not blind. You can‚Äôt explain
and you daren‚Äôt wait to be asked for an explanation.
It‚Äôs simply sielfishness, that‚Äôs what it is. And, what is
worse, you ‚Äô‚Äòdon‚Äôt want to go.‚Äù I blundered on and</p>
<p>44 THE COUNT^S COURTSHIP</p>
<p>on to the grim lady, venturing much further than I
had ever dreamed of doing ; and then fell suddenly
silent.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn some respects, that is the truth, Richard,‚Äù she
said at last, quite gently ‚Äî ‚ÄúI own that freely. But it‚Äôs
not fear or pusillanimity, and no injury, my boy. I am
in the right ; and yet it‚Äôs true 1 daren‚Äôt go to him and
tell him so. If I lifted a finger ‚Äî if, just as I am, I
Walked downstairs and went out and took a turn
with him in the garden, on the man‚Äô: an ‚Äî well, I ask
you. What would he do ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe‚Äôd pop the question,‚Äù I said vulgarly and re-
sentfully, ‚Äú and you know it. And a jolly good thing
too, for both of you. What‚Äôs more, you‚Äôve never
given him an atom of reason to suppose you wouldn‚Äôt
accept him.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI say that&rsquo;s untrue, Richard. And who asked for
your views on that, pray ? Be smart, sir, in better
season. The Count, you say, would ask me to be his
wife ‚Äî what then ? I am not too old ; I am not too
feeble; I am a practical housekeeper ! and ‚Äî ^I like the
man. He‚Äôd ask me to be his wife ‚Äî and then ‚Äî as I
walked in the garden with him, I should be stumbling
and peering, pushing and poking my way. Dark to
me ! Whatever the happiness within. Richard, you
poor blind creature, don‚Äôt you see it ? Can the Count
marry a woman who‚Äôs all but eyeless, who can but
glimmer to-day out of what will be sightless and
hopeless as that night outside, to-morrow ? I have
been struggling against the truth. I like being here.
Hike‚Äî Q|)^4iave stayed too long. You stupid, short-
sighted* men ! He has seen me ^y after ^y. He has</p>
<p>THE count&rsquo;s courtship 45</p>
<p>seen me go fingering on from chair to chair. Was I
biding it? Do I or do I not wear spectacles? Do they
distort my eyes till I look like an owl in a belfry ?
Should I wear this hideous monstrosity if ‚Äî you
should have seen, you should have guessed.‚Äù</p>
<p>I put my hand on my aunt‚Äôs as it lay on her knee.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGood Lord,‚Äù I muttered, and choked into
silence again.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it, Richard, that‚Äôs common sense,‚Äù she
said, squeezing my fingers. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all perfectly plain.
As duty always is, thank the Lord. He wants a
bright, active, capable wife ‚Äî if he wants any. A blind
old woman can‚Äôt be that. She can‚Äôt be, even if she
had the heart. I‚Äôm a silly, Richard, for all my sour
ways. Poor man, poor volatile generous creature.
He‚Äôs not quiet and stay-at-home, as his age should be.
He‚Äôs all capers, and fancies, and ‚Äî and romance. God
bless me, romance ! . . . And that‚Äôs the end of it.‚Äù</p>
<p>She stayed ; and we heard a light restless footfall
.upon the gravel beneath the window.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI never thought I should be saying aU this stuff
to you ; I had no such intention, Richard. But you‚Äôre
of my own blood, and that‚Äôs something. And now
off to bed with you, and not another word. Out
with him at ten, and back with him at twelve. And
my box,es at the week‚Äôs end.‚Äù</p>
<p>*‚ÄòLook here, my dear aunt ‚Äù I began.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou are going to tell me,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúthat it‚Äôs all
my fancy ; that roy eyes are as good as yours ; that
I shall wreck our old friend‚Äôs happiness. My dear
^chard, do you suppose that my questions to the
little snuff-coloured oculist were not sharp and to the</p>
<p>46 THE count‚Äôs courtshie</p>
<p>point ? Do you think life has not given me the
courage to know that one‚Äôs eyesight is at least as
precious and mortal as one‚Äôs heart ? Do you think
that an old woman, w‚Äôho ‚Ä¢was never idle in learning,
has not by this time read through and through your
old friend‚Äôs warm, fickle, proud, fantastic heart?
There are good things a woman can admire in a man,
besides mere stubborn adoration. And the Count has
most of ‚Äôem. So you see, you would have told me
only what ninety-nine young men would have told
me nearly as well. I think too much of you to listen
to it. The hundreth for me. There, gh&rsquo;^e me a kiss
and go av;^ay, Richard. I wish to retire.‚Äù</p>
<p>My aunt rose hastily, kissed me sharply on the
cheek, hurried me out of the room, and locked the
door after me.</p>
<p>While sitting there in her presence, I had almost
failed to see the folly of the business. Her pitiless
commonsense had made me an unwilling accomplice.
But as I turned over our talk in my mind, I was
tempted at once to betray her secret to the Count.
He, too, could be resolute and rational and inflexible
at need. Nevertheless, I realised how futile, how fatal
the attempt might prove.</p>
<p>To the letter then, I determined to obey her,
trusting to the Count‚Äôs genius and the placability of
fate for a happier conclusion. And even at that ‚Äî a
young man a good deal incensed with the ridiculous
obligations these two elderly victims had thrust upon
liim fou n d sleep that night very s tubborn of attainment.</p>
<p>I had little expected to see my aunt at breakfast
next morning ; but when the Count came in from the</p>
<p>THE COUNT^S COURTSHIP</p>
<p>garden, hot and boisterous, she sat waiting for
him, and greeted us with her usual cheerful gravity.
Only too clearly, however, my new knowledge
revealed the tragic truth of her secret of the night
before. She leaned forward a little on the table,
gazing steadily across it, her hands wandering lightly
over the cups, already half endowed with the dehcacy
^at length to come. Never had the Count been so
high-spirited, and she answered him jest for jest. Yet
not one sign did she vouchsafe to assure me of our
compact. She acted her part without a symptom of
flinching to the end.</p>
<p>In a rather clumsy fashion, I fear, I at last pro-
posed to the Count a walk over the Heath.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAn excellent suggestion, Richard,‚Äù said my aunt
cordially. ‚ÄúThere, Count, put on your hat, and take
your stick, and walk off the steam. It‚Äôs no use looking
at me. I have business to attend to, so I can‚Äôt come.‚Äù</p>
<p>But the Count was exceedingly unwilling to go.
The garden held more charm for him, and better
company, A faint groping uneasiness, too, showed
itself in his features.</p>
<p>But my aunt would heed no scruples, no reluct-
ances. ‚ÄúWhen a woman wants a man out of the way,
don‚Äôt you suppose. Count, that she knows best?‚Äù
she enquired lightly but firmly. ‚ÄúNow where‚Äôs your
stick?‚Äù</p>
<p>In her eagerness she stumbled against the door-
post, and the Count caught her impulsively by the
arm. Her cheek flushed crimson. For an instant I
fancied that fate had indeed intervened. But the next
minute the Count and 1 were hurried out of the house,</p>
<p>48 THE count‚Äôs COURTSHIE</p>
<p>and bound for the Heath. My aunt had herself shut
the door, and, heavy with fears and forebodings, I
supposed that this was the end of the matter.</p>
<p>It was a quiet summer morning, the sunshine sweet
with the nutty and almond scents of bracken and
gorse. At first, in our walk, the Count was inclined
to be satirical. He scoffed at every remark I made,
and scoffed at his scoffing. But at the bottom of the
hoUow his mood swerved to the opposite extreme.
He walked, bent morosely, without raising his eyes
from the grass. His only answer to every little remark
I volunteered w&rsquo;as a shrug or a grunt. His pace dimin-
ished more and more until at last he suddenly
stopped, as if some one had spoken to him. And
he turned his face towards home.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù he said to me.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWrong ?‚Äù said I.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI heard your aunt calling.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúNonsense,‚Äù I said ; ‚Äúshe‚Äôs two miles distant at
least.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòNonsense‚Äô !‚Äù said he angrily : ‚ÄúI say I heard her
calling. Am I all skin and bone ? I‚Äôm done with the
Heath.‚Äù</p>
<p>I remonstrated in vain. It only served to make
things worse. At each word the Count‚Äôs disquietude
increased, he was the more obstinately bent on
returning.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHome, boy, home 1 I‚Äôll not be gainsaid.‚Äù</p>
<p>I threatened to go on alone ; but the threat, I
knew, was futile, and proved me at my last resource.</p>
<p>It was not until we were within a few yards of the
house that, on turning a corner, we came in sight of</p>
<p>THE count‚Äôs courtship 49</p>
<p>the cab. With a sagacity that almost amounted to
divination, the Count jumped at once to the cause of
its presence there.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it mean ?‚Äù he hoarsely shouted, and
waved his stick in the air. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that cab mean, I
say ? What‚Äôs it mean ? Have you no answer, eh ?‚Äù But
after that one swift white glance at my face, he said
no more. ‚ÄúBring that box into the house, sir,‚Äù he
bawled to the cabman, ‚Äúand drive your cab to the
devil.‚Äù</p>
<p>I followed him into the house, and the tempest
of his wrath raged through it like a cloud. My aunt
was notin the dining-room. Janet had fled away into
the kitchen. And I suppose by this time my aunt had
heard the uproar of his home-coming, for when the
Count assailed her door it was secure, and she was
in a stronghold.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMrs. Lindsay ! what‚Äôs this mean ?‚Äù he shouted.
‚ÄúWhat have I done, that you should be leaving my
house like this ? Am I so far in my dotage that I
must be cheated like a child ? Is it open with me ?
You shall not go. You shall not go. I‚Äôll burn the cab
first. You daren‚Äôt face me, Mrs. Lindsay.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúCount, Count,‚Äù said I, ‚Äúevery word ‚Äî the neigh-
bours.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe neighbours ! the neighbours !‚Äù his scorn
broke over me. ‚ÄúLook to your own pottering milksop
business, sir ! Now, Mrs. Lindsay, now !‚Äù</p>
<p>In envious admiration I heard my aunt open her
door. For an instant there was no soundin the house.</p>
<p>‚ÄúCotmt,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúI will just ask you to go
quietly down to your study and remain there for</p>
<p>50 THE COUNT*S COURTSHIP</p>
<p>five minutes. By that time I shall be ready to s
good-bye to you.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúLucy, my dear friend,‚Äù said the Count ‚Äî and :
the resentment was gone out of his voice ‚Äî ‚ÄúI a
only one thing : you will not treat me like this ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúFive minutes. Count, five minutes,‚Äù said my aun</p>
<p>The Count came downstairs. He paid no heed
me ; went into his study and shut the door. T1
cabman was on the doorstep.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRichard,‚Äù said my aunt from the loop of tl
stairs, ‚Äúthe cabman will carry out my orders.‚Äù</p>
<p>I went up slowly and tapped at my aunt‚Äôs doo
She would not open to me.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou have failed, Richard, that is all ; a man can
do worse,‚Äù she called to me from the other side c
the panels.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe insisted, aunt,‚Äù I pleaded. ‚ÄúI almost use
force.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt doubt it,‚Äù she said ; ‚Äúyou used all th
force that was in you. There, leave me now. I hav
other things to think about.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn my word of honour, believe me or not, Aun
Lucy,‚Äù I cried, ‚ÄúI have done my best. T hear he
calling‚Äô ‚Äî that‚Äôs what he kept saying : and home hi
came. I would have given anything. Let me tell him
I saw his face just now. Aunt Lucy, he‚Äôs an old mat</p>
<p>‚ÄúListen, Richard,‚Äù she answered, and she was
pressing close to the door. ‚ÄúSay no more. I spoke
hastily. I have thought it out ; the day will pass ;
and all the noise and fret over. But, but‚Äî are you
there, Richard ?‚Äù She whispered in so low a voice</p>
<p>THE count‚Äôs courtship 51</p>
<p>that I could scarcely catch the words, ‚ÄúI go because
I‚Äôm tired of it all ; want liberty, ease ; tell him that.
‚ÄòJust like a woman !‚Äô say ; anything that sounds best
to rid him of this ‚Äî ^fancy. Do you see ? ‚Äî and not a
single word about the eyes. Richard 1 do you see ?
You have failed me once. I am trusting you again.
That‚Äôs all.‚Äù</p>
<p>S.o I went down and sat a while with my own
thoughts to entertain me, in the little room with the
French windows and the stuffed birds. In a few
minutes I heard my aunt‚Äôs footsteps descending the
stairs. She was all but groping her way with extreme
caution, step by step. Veil or bonnet, I know not
what, had added years to her face. I had not heard
the Count open his door. But in a flash I caught sight
of him, on the threshold, stiff as a mute.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLucy,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúlisten. For all that I said ‚Äî for
an old man‚Äôs noise and fury ‚Äî forgive me I That is
past. My dear friend, aU that I ask now is this ‚Äî will
you be my wife ?‚Äù</p>
<p>My aunt‚Äôs eyebrows were arched above her spec-
tacles. She smoothed her wrinkled forehead with
her fingers. ‚ÄúWhat did you say. Count ?‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI said 1 am sorry ‚Äî beyond all words. And oh,
my dear, dear lady, will you be my wife ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAch‚Äî -nonsense, nonsense, old friend,‚Äù said my
aunt. ‚ÄúAnd you and me so old and staid 1 Grey
hairs. Withered sticks. From the bottom of my&rsquo;
heart I thank you for the honour. But‚Äî why. Count,
you discommode an ‚Äî an old woman.‚Äù She laughed
like a girl.</p>
<p>And she pushed her gloved hand along the wall</p>
<p>54 THB count‚Äôs COURTSHIP</p>
<p>of the passage, moving very heedfuUy and slowly.
‚ÄúRichard, may I ask you just once more to support
my poor gouty knees down these odious steps ?‚Äù
My aimt was speaking in a foreign tongue. The
Count strode after us.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIs this aU ?‚Äù said he, gaaing into her face.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGod bless the man !- -would he stare me out of
countenance ?‚Äù Her hand felt limp and cold beneath
her glove. And we went out of the house into the
sunlight, and descended slowly to the cab.</p>
<p>And that was the end of the matter. My aunt had
divined the truth. Her volatile, fickle, proud, fantastic
old friend moped for a while. But soon the inter-
vention of scribbling, projects, books, and dissen-
sions with lus neighbours added this one more to
many another romantic episode in his charming
repertory of memories. Moreover, had my aunt
chosen to return, here was a brotherly affection,
flavoured with a platonic piquancy, eager to welcome,
to serve, and to entertain her.</p>
<p>Not for many a year did I meet my aunt again. I
twice ventured to call on her ; but she was ‚Äúout‚Äù to
me. Rumours strayed my way at times of a soured
blind old woman, for ever engaged in scandalous
contention with the parents of her domestics ; but
me she altogether ignored. And then for a long
time I feared to force myself on her memory. But
when the end came, and the Count was speedily
sinking, some odd remembrance of her troubled his
sleep. He begged me to write to my aunt, to *ask
her to come and share a last crust with an old
broken, toothless friend.&rsquo; But my poor old friend</p>
<p>THE count‚Äôs courtship 53</p>
<p>died the next evening, and the last stillness had fallen
upon the house before she could answer his summons.</p>
<p>On the day following I was sitting in the empty and
darkened dining-room, when I heard the sound of
wheels, and somehow divining what they portended,
I looked out through the Venetian blind.</p>
<p>My aunt had come, as she had gone, in a hackney
cab j and, refusing any assistance from the maid who
was there with her, she stepped painfully down out
of it, and, tappmg the ground at her feet with her
ebony stick, the wintry sun glinting red upon her
blue spectacles as she moved, she began to climb
the flight of steps alone, with difficulty, but with a
vigorous assurance.</p>
<p>I was seized with dismay at the very sight of her.
Something in her very appearance filled me v/ith a
sense of my own mere young-manliness and fatuity. I
drew sharply back from the window ; hesitated ‚Äî in
doubt whether to receive her myself, or to send for
Mrs. Rodd. I peeped again. She had come on slowly.
But now, midway up the steps, she paused, slowly
turned herself about, and stretched out her hand
towards the house.</p>
<p>‚ÄúCabman, cabman‚Äù ‚Äî her words rang against the
stucco walls ‚Äî ‚Äúis this the house ? What‚Äôs wrong with
the house ?‚Äù</p>
<p>The cabman began to climb down from his box.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAgnes, do you hear me ?‚Äù she cried with a shrill
piercing horror in her voice. ‚ÄúAgnes, Agnes ‚Äî is the
house dark ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe blinds are all down, m‚Äôm,‚Äù answered the girl
looking out of the window.</p>
<p>54 THE count‚Äôs courtship</p>
<p>My aunt turned her head slowly, and I could see
her moving eyebrows arched high above her spec-
tacles. And then she began to climb rapidly backwards
down the steps in her haste to be gone. It was a
ludicrous and yet a poignant and dreadful thing to
see. I could refrain myself no longer.</p>
<p>But she was already seated in the cab before I
could reach her. ‚ÄúAunt, my dear Aunt Lucy,‚Äù I said
at the window, peering into the musty gloom.
‚ÄúWon‚Äôt you please come into the house ? I have
many things ‚Äî a ring ‚Äî books ‚Äî he spoke often ‚Äù</p>
<p>She turned and confronted me, in very speechless
entreaty in her blind face ‚Äî an entreaty not to me, for
no earthly help, past all hope of answer, it seemed ;
and then, with an extraordinary certainty of aim, she
began beating my hand that lay upon the narrow
window-frame with the handle of her ebony stick.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDrive on, drive on !‚Äù she cried. ‚Äú God bless the
man, why doesn‚Äôt he drive on ?‚Äù The jet butterflies
in her bonnet trembled above her crimsoned brow.
The cabman brandished his whip. And that was
quite the end. I never saw my aunt again.</p>
<p>THE LOOKING-GLASS</p>
<p>F or an hour or two in the afternoon. Miss Len-
nox had always made it a rule to retire to her
own room for a little rest, so that for this brief
interval, at any rate, Alice was at liberty to do just
what she pleased with herself. The ‚Äújust what she
pleased,‚Äù no doubt, was a little limited in range ; and
‚Äúwith herself ‚Äù was at best no very vast oasis amid its
‚Äòsands.</p>
<p>She might, for example, like Miss Lennox, rest,
too, if she pleased. Miss Lennox prided herself on
her justice.</p>
<p>But then, Alice could seldom sleep in the after-
noon because of her troublesome cough. She might
at a pinch write letters, but they would need to be
nearly aU of them addressed to imaginary corres-
pondents. And not even the most romantic of young
human beings can write on indefinitely to one who
vouchsafes no kind of an answer. The choice in fact
merely amounted to that between being ‚Äúin‚Äù or
‚Äúout‚Äù (in any sense), and now that the severity of the
winter had abated, Alice much preferred the solitude
of the garden to the vacancy of the house.</p>
<p>With rain came an extraordinary beauty to the
narrow garden ‚Äî its trees drenched, refreshed, and
glittering at break of evening, its early flowers stoop-
ing pale above the darkened earth, the birds that
hatinted there singing as if out of a cool and happy
cloister ‚Äî the stormcock wildly jubilant. There was
one particular thrush on one particular tree which
you might say all but yeUed messages at Alice, mes-</p>
<p>j6 THE LOOKING GLASS</p>
<p>sages which sometimes made her laugh, and some-
times almost ready to cry, with delight.</p>
<p>And yet ever the same vague influence seemed to
haunt her young mind. Scarcely so much as a mood ;
nothing in the nature of a thought ; merely an in-
fluence ‚Äîlike that of some impressive stranger met ‚Äî
in a dream, say ‚Äî ^long ago, and now half-forgotten.</p>
<p>This may have been in part because the low and
foundering wall between the empty meadows and her
own recess of greenery had always seemed to her like
the boundary between two worlds. On the one side
freedom, the wild ; on this. Miss Lennox, and a sort
of captivity. There Reality ; here (her ‚Äúduties‚Äù al-
most forgotten) the confines of a kind of waking
dream. For this reason, if for no other, she at the
same time longed for and yet in a way dreaded the
afternoon‚Äôs regular reprieve.</p>
<p>It had proved, too, both a comfort and a vexation
that the old servant belonging to the new family next
door had speedily discovered this little habit, and
would as often as not lie in wait for her between a
bush of lUac and a bright green chestnut that stood
up like a dense umbrella midway along the wall that
divided Miss Lennox‚Äôs from its one neighbouring
garden. And since apparently it was Alice‚Äôs destiny
in life to be always precariously balanced between
extremes, Sarah had also turned out to be a creature
of rather peculiar oscillations of temperament.</p>
<p>Their clandestine talks were, therefore, though
frequent, seldom particularly enlightening. None the
less, merely to see this slovenly ponderous woman
enter the garden, self-centred, with a kind of dull</p>
<p>THE LOOKING GLASS 57</p>
<p>arrogance, her louring face as vacant as contempt
of the Universe could make it, was an event ever
eagerly, though at times vexatiously, looked for, and
seldom missed.</p>
<p>Until but a few steps separated them, it was one of
Sarah‚Äôs queer habits to make believe, so to speak,
that Alice was not there at all. Then, as regularly,
from her place of vantage on the other side of the
wall, she would slowly and heavily lift her eyes to her
face, with a sudden energy which at first considerably
&lsquo;alarmed the young girl, and afterwards amused her.
For certainly you are amused in a sort of fashion
when any stranger you might suppose to be a little
queer in the head proves perfectly harmless. Alice
did not exactly like Sarah. But she could no more
resist her advances, than the garden could resist the
coming on of night.</p>
<p>Miss Lennox, too, it must be confessed, was a
rather tedious and fretful companion for wits (like
Alice‚Äôs) always wool-gathering ‚Äî wool, moreover, of
the shimmering kind that decked the Golden Fleece.
Her own conception of the present was of a niche in
Time from which she was accustomed to look back
on the dim, though once apparently garish, pano-
rama of the past ; while with /Mice, Time had kept
promises enough only for a surety of its immense
resources ‚Äî resources Ulimitable, even though up
till now they had been pretty tightly withheld.</p>
<p>Or, if you so preferred, as Alice would say to her-
self, you could put it that Miss Lennox had all her
eggs in a real basket, and that Alice had all hers in a
basket that was mt exactly real‚Äî only problematical.</p>
<p>58 THE LOOKING GLASS</p>
<p>All the more reason, then, for Alice to think it a
little queer that it had been Miss Lennox herself and
not Sarah who had first&rdquo; given shape and substance
to her vaguely bizarre intuitions concerning the
garden ‚Äî a walled-in space in which one might sup-
pose intuition alone could discover anything in the
least remarkable</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen my cousin, Mary Wilson (the Wilsons of
Aberdeen, as I may have told you), when my cousin
lived in this house,‚Äù she had informed her young&rsquo;
companion, one evening over her own milk and
oatmeal biscuits, ‚Äúthere was a sL‚Äùy talk with the
maids that it was haunted.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe house ?‚Äù Alice had enquired, with a sudden
crooked look on a face that Nature, it seemed, had
definitely intended to be frequendy startled ; ‚ÄúThe
house ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say the house&rsquo;* Miss Lennox testily replied
‚Äî it always annoyed her to see anything resembling
a flush on her young companion‚Äôs cheek, ‚Äúand even
if I did, I certainly manf the garden. If I had meant
the house, I should have used the word house. I
meant the garden. It was quite unnecessary to cor-
rect or contradict me ; and whether or not, it‚Äôs all the
purest rubbish ‚Äî just a tale, though not the only one
of the kind in the world, I fancy.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúDo you remember any of the other tales ?‚Äù Alice
had enquired, after a rather prolonged pause.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo, none‚Äù; was the flat reply.</p>
<p>And so it came about that to Sarah (though she
could hardly be described as the Serpent of the situ-
ation) to Sarah fell the opportunity of enjoying to the</p>
<p>THE LOOKING GLASS 59</p>
<p>full an opening for her fantastic ‚Äúlore.‚Äù Bv insinu-
ation, by silences, now with contemptuous scepti-
cism, now with enormous warmth, she cast her spell,
weaving an eager imagination through and through
with the rather gaudy threads of superstition.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLor, no. Crimes, maybe not, though blood is in
the roots for all I can say.‚Äù She had looked up al-
most candidly in the warm, rainy wind, her deadish-
looldng hair blown back from her forehead.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSome‚ÄôU tell you only the old people have eyes to
see the mystery ; and some, old or young, if so be
they‚Äôre ripe. Nothing to me either way ; Fm gone
past such things. And what it is, ‚Äôorror and darkness,
or golden like a saint in heaven, or pictures in dreams,
or just like dying fireworks in the air, the Lord alone
knows. Miss, for I don‚Äôt. But this I will say,‚Äù and
she edged up her body a little closer to the wall, the
raindrops the while dropping sofdy on bough and
grass, ‚ÄúMay-day‚Äôs the day, and midnight‚Äôs the hour,
for such as be wakeful and brazen and stoopid enough
to watch it out. And what you‚Äôve got to look for in
a manner of speaking is what comes up out of the
darkness from behind them trees there I‚Äù</p>
<p>She drew back cunningly.</p>
<p>The conversation was just like clockwork. It
recurred regularly‚Äî except that there was no need to
wind anything up. It wound itself up over-night,
and with such accuracy that Alice soon knew the
complete series of question and answer by heart or
by rote ‚Äî as if she had learned them out of the Child‚Äôs
Guide to Knowledge, or the Catechism. Still there
were interesting points in it even now.</p>
<p>6o THE LOOKING GLASS</p>
<p>^Attd what you‚Äôve got to look for‚Äô you was so</p>
<p>absurdif impersonal when muttered in that thick
coarse privy voice. And Alice invariably smiled at
this litde juncture ; and Sarah as invariably looked
at her and swallowed.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut have yoti looked for ‚Äî ^for what you say, you
know ?‚Äù Alice would then enquire, still with face a
little averted towards the black low-boughed group
of broad-leafed chestnuts, positive candelabra in
their own season of wax-hke speckled blossom.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMe ? Me ? I was old before my time, they used
to say. Why, besides my poor sister np in Yorkshire
there, there‚Äôs not a mouth utters my name.‚Äù Her large
flushed face smiled in triumphant irony. ‚ÄúBesides
my bed-rid mistress there, and my old what they call
feeble-minded sister, Jane Maiy, in Yorkshire, I‚Äôm
as good as in my grav&rsquo;e. I may be dull and hot in the
head at times, but I stand alone ‚Äî eat alone, sit alone,
sleep alone, think alone. There‚Äôs never been such a
lonely person before. Now, what should such a
lonely person as me. Miss, I ask you, or what should
you either for that matter, be meddling with your
Maydays and your haunted gardens for?‚Äù She broke
oflF and stared with angry confusion around her, and,
lifting up her open hand a little, she added hotly,
‚ÄúThem birds ! ‚Äî My God, I drats ‚Äôem for their
squealin‚Äô 1‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut, why ?‚Äù said Alice, frowning slightly.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Lord only knows. Miss ; I hate the si^ht of
‚Äôem ! If I had what they call a blunderbuss m me
hand I‚Äôd blow ‚Äôem to ribbings.‚Äù</p>
<p>And Alice never could quite understand why it</p>
<p>THE LOOKING GLASS 6l</p>
<p>was that the normal pronunciation of the word would
have suggested a less complete dismemberment of the
victims.</p>
<p>It was on a bleak day in March that Alice first heard
really explicitly the conditions of the quest.</p>
<p>‚Äò&lsquo;Your hows and whys ! What I say is I‚Äôm sick of
it all. Not so much of you. Miss, which is all greens
to me, but of the rest of it all ! Anyhow, fast you
must, like the Cartholics, and you with a frightful
hacking cough and all. Come like a new-begotten
bride you must in a white gown, and a wreath of
lillies or rorringe-blossom in your hair, same pretty
much as I made for my mother‚Äôs coffin this twenty
years ago, and which I wouldn‚Äôt do now not for re-
spectability even. And me and my mother, let me tell
you, were as close as hens in a roost. . . . But I‚Äôm
off me subject. There you sits, even if the snow itself
comes sailing in on your face, and alone you must
be, neither book nor candle, and the house behmd
you shut up black abed and asleep. But, there ; you
so wan and sickly a young lady. What ghost would
come to you, I‚Äôd like to know. You want some fine
dark loveyer for a ghost ‚Äî that‚Äôs your ghost. Oo-ay !
There‚Äôs not a want in the world but‚Äôs dust and ashes.
That‚Äôs my bit of schooling.‚Äù</p>
<p>She gazed on impenetrably at Alice‚Äôs slender
fingers. And without raising her eyes she leaned her
large hands on the wall,‚ÄúMeself, Miss, meself ‚Äôs my
ghost, as they say. Why, bless me ! it‚Äôs all thro‚Äô the
place now, like smoke.‚Äù</p>
<p>mat was all through the place now like smoke
Alice perceived to be the peculiar clarity of the air</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>THE LOOKING GLASS</p>
<p>discernible in the garden at times. The dearness as
it were of glass, of a looking-glass, which conceals
all behind and beyond it, returning only the looker‚Äôs
wonder, or simply her vanity, or even her gaiety.
Why, for the matter of that, thought Alice smiling,
there are people who look into looking-glasses,
actually see themselves there, and yet never turn a
hair.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t any glass, of course. Its sort of
mirage sprang only out of the desire of her eyes, out
of a restless hunger of the mind ‚Äî just to possess her
soul in patience till the first favourable May evening
came along and then once and for all to set every-
thing at rest. It was a thought which fascinated her
so completely, that it influenced her habits, her words,
her actions. She even began to long for the afternoon
solely to be alone with it ; and in the midst of the
reverie it charmed into her mind, she would glance
up as startled as a Dryad to see the ‚Äúcook-general‚Äôs‚Äù
dark face fixing its still cold gaze on her from over
the moss-greened wall. As for Miss Lennox, she be-
came testier and more ‚Äúrational‚Äù than ever as she
narrowly watched the day approaching when her
need for a new companion would become extreme.</p>
<p>Who, however, the lover might be, and where the
trysting-place, was unknown even to Alice, though,
maybe, not absolutely unsurmised by her, and with
a kind of cunning perspicacity perceived only by
Sarah.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI sec my old tales have tickled you up. Miss,‚Äù
she said one day, lifting her eyes from the clothes-
line she was carrying to the girl‚Äôs alert and mobile</p>
<p>THE LOOKING GLASS 65</p>
<p>face. ‚ÄúWhat they call old wives‚Äô tales I fancy, too,‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt think so,‚Äù Alice answered. ‚ÄúI can
hardly tell, Sarah. I am only at peace here, I know
that. I get out of bed at night to look down from the
window and wish myself here. When I‚Äôm reading,
just as if it were a painted illustration ‚Äî in the book,
you know ‚Äî ^the scene of it all floats in between me
and the print. Besides, I can do just what I like with
it. In my mind, I mean. I just imagine ; and there it
all is. So you see I could not bear now to go away.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no cause to worry your head about that,‚Äù
said the woman darkly, ‚Äúand as for picking and
choosing I never saw much of it for them that‚Äôs under
of a thumb. Why, when I was young, I couldn‚Äôt
have borne to live as I do now with just meself
wandering to and fro. Muttering I catch meself, too.
And, to be sure, surrounded in the air by shapes, and
shadows, and noises, and winds, so as sometimes I
can neither see nor hear. It‚Äôs true, God‚Äôs gospel.
Miss ‚Äî the body‚Äôs like a clump of wood, it‚Äôs that
dull. And you can‚Äôt get t‚Äôother side, so to speak.‚Äù</p>
<p>So lucid a pourtrayal of her own exact sensations
astonished the girl. ‚ÄúWell, but what is it, what is it,
Sarah ?‚Äù</p>
<p>Sarah strapped the air with the loose end of the
clothes-line, ‚ÄúPart, Miss, the hauntin‚Äô of the garden.
Part as them black-jacketed clergymen would say,
because we‚Äôs we. And part ‚Äôcos it‚Äôs all death the
other side ‚Äî all death.‚Äù</p>
<p>She drew her head slowly in, her puffy cheeks
glowed, her small black eyes gazed as fixedly and
deadly as if they were anemones on a rock.</p>
<p>64 THE LOOKING GLASS</p>
<p>The very fulness of her figure seemed to exaggerate
her vehemence. She gloated ‚Äî a heavy somnolent
owl puffing its feathers. Alice drew back, swiftly
glancing as she did so over her shoulder. The sun-
light was liquid wan gold in the meadow, between
the black tree-trunks. They lifted their cumbrous
branches fat above the brick human house, stoop-
ing their leafy twigs. A starling‚Äôs dark iridescence
took her glance as he minced pertly in the coarse grass.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI can‚Äôt quite see whyjo// should think of death,‚Äù
Alice ventured to suggest.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMe ? Not me ! Where I‚Äôm put, I stay. I‚Äôm like
a stone in the grass, I am. Not that if I were that old
mealy-smilin‚Äô bag of bones flat on her back on her
bed up there with her bits of beadwork and slops
through a spout, I wouldn‚Äôt make sure over-night
of not being waked next mornin‚Äô. There‚Äôs something
in me that won‚Äôt let me rest, what they call a volcano,
though no more to eat in that beetle cupboard of a
kitchen than would keep a Tom Cat from the mange.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut, Sarah,‚Äù said Alice, casting a glance up at the
curtained windows of the other house, ‚Äú she looks
such a quiet, patient old thing. I don‚Äôt think I could
stand having not even enough to eat. Why do you
stay ?‚Äù</p>
<p>Sarah laughed for a full half-minute in silence,
staring at Alice meanwhile. ‚Äú ‚ÄòPatient ‚Äô !‚Äù she replied
at last, ‚ÄúOo-ay. Nor to my knowledge did I ever
breathe the contrarj‚Äô. As for staying ; you‚Äôd stay all
right if that loveyer of yours come along. You‚Äôd
stand anything ‚Äî them pale narrow-chested kind ;
though me. I‚Äôm neether to bend nor break. And. if</p>
<p>the LOOK! lie GLASS 6j</p>
<p>the old man was to look down out of the blue up
there this very minute, ay, and shake his fist at me.
I‚Äôd say it to his face. I loathe your whining psalm-
singers. A trap‚Äôs a trap. You wait and see !‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut how do you mean ?‚Äù Alice said slowly, her
face stooping.</p>
<p>There came no answer. And, on turning, she was
surprised to see the bunchy alpaca-clad woman al-
ready disappearing round the corner of the house.</p>
<p>The talk softly subsided in her mind like the dust
in an empty room. Alice wandered on in the garden,
extremely loth to go in. And gradually a curious
happiness at last descended upon her heart, like a
cloud of morning dew in a dell of wild-flowers. It
seented in moments like these, as if she had been
given the power to think ‚Äî or rather to be conscious,
as it were, of thoughts not her own ‚Äî thoughts like
vivid pictures, following one upon another with ex-
traordinary rapidity and brightness through her
mind. As if, indeed, thoughts could be like frag-
ments of glass, reflecting light at their every edge
and angle. She stood tiptoe at the meadow wall and
gazed greedily into the green fields, and across to the
pollard aspens by the waterside. Turning, her eyes
recognised clear in the shadow and blue-gray air of
the garden her solitude ‚Äî its solitude. And at once
all thinking ceased.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Spirit is me : I haunt this place I‚Äù she said
aloud, with sudden assurance, and almost in Sarah‚Äôs
own words. ‚ÄúAnd I don‚Äôt mind ‚Äî not the least bit.
It can be only my thankful, thankful self that is here.
And that can neper be lost.‚Äù</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>THE LOOKING GLASS</p>
<p>She returned to the house, and seemed as she
moved to see ‚Äî almost as if she were looking down
out of the sky on herself‚Äî her own dwarf figure
walking beneath the trees. Yet there was at the same
time a curious individuality in the common things,
living and inanimate, that were peeping at her out
of their secrecy. The silence hung above them as
apparent as their own clear reflected colours above
the brief Spring flowers. But when she stood tidying
herself for the usual hour of reading to Miss Lennox,
she was conscious of an almost unendurable weari-
ness.</p>
<p>That night Alice set to work with her needle upon a
piece of sprigged muslin to malce her ‚Äúwatch-gown‚Äù
as Sarah called it. She was excited. She hadn‚Äôt much
time, she fancied. It was like hiding in a story. She
worked with extreme pains, and quickly. And not
tin the whole flimsy thing was finished did she try
on or admire any part of it. But, at last, in the early
evening of one of the middle days of April, she
drew her bedroom blind up close to the ceiling, to
view herself in her yellow grained looking-glass.</p>
<p>The gown, white as milk in the low sunught, and
sprinkled with even whiter embroidered nosegays of
daisies, seemed to attentuate a girlish figure, already
very slender. She had arranged her abundant hair
with unusual care, and her own clear, inexplicable
eyes looked back upon her beauty, bright it seemed
with tidings they could not speak.</p>
<p>She regarded closely that narrow, flushed, intense
face in an unforseen storm of compassion and regret,
as if with the conviction that she herself was to</p>
<p>THE LOOKING GLASS 67</p>
<p>blame for the inevitable leavetaking. It seemed to
gaze like an animal its mute farewell in the dim dis-
coloured glass.</p>
<p>And when she had folded and laid away the gown
in her wardrobe, and put on her everyday clothes
again, she felt an extreme aversion for the garden.
So, instead of venturing out that afternoon, she
slipped off its faded blue ribbon from an old bundle
of letters which she had hoarded all these years from
a school-friend long since lost sight of, and spent the
evening reading them over, till headache and an
empty despondency sent her to bed.</p>
<p>Lagging Time brought at length the thirtieth of
April. Life was as usual. Miss Lennox had even
begun to knit her eighth pair of woollen mittens for
the annual Church bazaar. To Alice the day passed
rather quickly ; a cloudy, humid day with a hirtive
continual and enigmatical stir in the air. Her lips were
parched ; it seemed at any moment her skull might
crack with the pain as she sat reading her chapter of
Macaulay to Miss Lennox‚Äôs sparking and clicking
needles. Her mind was a veritable rookery of fore-
bodings, flying and returning. She scarcely ate at all,
and kept to the house, never even approaching a
window. She wrote a long and rather unintelligible
letter, which she destroyed when she had read it over.
Then suddenly every vestige of pain left her.</p>
<p>And when at last she went to bed‚Äî so breathless that
she thought her heart at any moment would jump out
of her body, and so saturated with expectancy she
thought she would die ‚Äî her candle was left burning
calmly, unnodding, in its socket upon the chest of</p>
<p>THE LOOKING GLASS</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>drawers ; the blind of her window was up, towards
the houseless byroad ; her pen stood in the inkpot.</p>
<p>She slept on into the morning of Mayday, in a
sheet of eastern sunshine, tiU Miss Lennox, with a
peevishness that almost amounted to resolution, de-
cided to wake her. But then, Alice, though unbe-
known in any really conscious sense to herself,
perhaps, had long since decided not to be awakened.</p>
<p>Not until the evening of that day did the sun in.
his diurnal course for a while illumine the garden,
and then very briefly : to gild, to lull, and to be gone.
The stars wheeled on in the thick-sown waste of
space, and even when Miss Lennox‚Äôs small share of
the earth‚Äôs wild living creatures had stirred and sunk
again to rest in the ebb of night, there came no
watcher ‚Äî not even the very ghost of a watcher ‚Äî to
the garden, in a watch-gown. So that what peculiar
secrets found reflex in its dark mirror no human
witness was there to tell.</p>
<p>As for Sarah, she had long since done with looking-
glasses once and for all. A place was a place. There
was still the washing to be done on Mondays. Fools
and weaklings would continue to come and go. But</p>
<p>g &rsquo;ve her her way, she‚Äôd have blown them and their
oking-glasses all to ribbons ‚Äî with the birds.</p>
<p>MISS DUVEEN</p>
<p>1 SELDOM had the company of children in my grand-
mother‚Äôs house beside the river Wandle. The
house was old and ugly. But its river was lovely
and youthful though it had flowed for ever, it seemed,
between its green banks of osier and alder. So it
was no great misfortune perhaps that I heard more
talking of its waters than of any human tongue. For
‚Ä¢my grandmother found no particular pleasure m my
company. How should she ? My father and mother
had married (and died) against her will, and there
was nothing in me of those charms which, in fiction
at any rate, swiftly soften a superannuated heart.</p>
<p>Nor did I pine for her company either. I kept out
of it as much as possible.</p>
<p>It so happened that she was accustomed to sit with
her back to the window of the room which she
usually occupied, her grey old indifferent face looking
inwards. Whenever necessary, I would steal close up
under it, and if I could see there her large faded ame-
thyst velvet cap I knew I was safe from interruption.
Sometimes I would take a slice or two of currant
bread or (if I could get it) a jam tart or a cheese cake,
and eat it under a twisted old damson tree or beside
ihe running water. And if I conversed with anybody,
it would be with myself or with my small victims of
the chase.</p>
<p>Not that I was an exceptionally cruel boy ; though
if I had lived on for many years in this primitive and
cot^anionless fashion, I should surely have become
an idiot. As a matter of fact, I was unaware even that</p>
<p>MISS DUVEEN</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>I was ridiculously old-fashioned ‚Äî ^manners, clothes,
notions, everything. My grandmother never troubled
to tell me so, nor did she care. And the servants
were a race apart. So I was left pretty much to my
own devices. What wonder, then, if I at first accepted
with g&rsquo;*nuine avidity the acquaintanceship of our re-
markable neighbour, I^fiss Duveen ?</p>
<p>It had been, indeed, quite an advent in our un-
eventful routine when that somewhat dubious house-
hold moved into WUlowlea, a brown brick edifice,&rdquo;
even uglier than our own, which had been long
vacant, and whose sloping garden confronted ours
across the Wandle. My grandmother, on her part,
at once discovered that any kind of intimacy with its
inmates was not much to be desired. While I, on
mine, was compelled to resign myself to the loss of
the W&rsquo;^illowlea garden as a kind of No Man‚Äôs Land or
Tom Tiddler‚Äôs ground.</p>
<p>I got to know Miss Duveen by sight long before
we actually became friends. I used frequently to
watch her wandering in her long garden. And even
then I noticed how odd were her methods of garden-
ing. She would dig up a root or carry off a potted
plant from one to another overgrown bed with an
almost animal-like resolution ; and a few minutes
afterwards I would see her restoring it to the place
from which it had come. Now and again she would
stand perfectly still, like a scarecrow, as if she had
completely forgotten what she was at.</p>
<p>Miss Coppin, too, I descried sometimes. But I
never more than glanced at her, for fear that even at
that distance the too fixed attention of my eyes might</p>
<p>MISSDUVEEN 7I</p>
<p>bring hers to bear upon me. She was a smallish
woman, inclined to be fat, and with a peculiar wadd-
ling gait. She invariably appeared to be angry with
Miss Duveen, and would talk to her as one might
talk to a post. I did not know, indeed, until one day
Miss Duveen waved her handkerchief in my direction
that I had been observed from Willowlea at all.
Once or twice after that, I fancied, she called me ;
at le‚Äôast her lips moved ; but I could not distinguish
what she said. And I was naturally a little backward
in making new friends. Still I grew accustomed to
looking out for her and remember distinctly how
first we met.</p>
<p>It was raining, the raindrops falling softly into the
unrippled water, making their great circles, and
tapping on the motionless leaves above my head
where I sat m shelter on the bank. But the sun w^as
shining whitcly from behind a thin fleece of cloud,
when Miss Duveen suddenly peeped in at me out of
the greenery, the thin silver light upon her face, and
eyed me sitting there, for all the world as if she were a
blackbird and 1 a snail. I scrambled up hastily with
the intention of retreating into my own domain, but
the peculiar grimace she made at me fixed me where
I was.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAh,‚Äù she said, with a little masculine laugh, ‚ÄúSo
this is the young gentleman, the bold, gallant young
gentleman. And what might be his name ?‚Äù</p>
<p>1 replied rather distantly that my name was Arthur.</p>
<p>‚ÄúArthur, to be sure 1‚Äù she repeated with extra-
orc^ary geniality, and again, ‚ÄúArthur,‚Äù as if in the
strictest confidence.</p>
<p>MISS DUVEEN</p>
<p>7Z</p>
<p>‚ÄúI know you, Arthur, very well indeed. I have
looked, I have watched ; and now, please God, we
need never be estranged.‚Äù And she tapped her brow
and breast, making the Sign of the Cross with her
lean, bluish forefinger.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat is a little brawling brook,‚Äù she went on,
‚Äúto friends like you and me ?‚Äù She gathered up
her tiny countenance once more into an incredible
grimace of friendliness ; and I smiled as amicably as
I could in return. There was a pause in this one-sided
conversation. She seemed to be listening, and her
lips moved, though I caught no so‚Äômd. In my un-
easiness I was just about to turn stealthily away, when
she poked forward again.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYes, yes, I know you quite intimately, Arthur.
We have met here‚Äù She tapped her rounded fore-
head. ‚ÄúYou might not suppose it, too ; but I have
eyes like a lynx. It is no exaggeration, I assure you
‚Äî assure everybody. And now what friends we will
be ! At times,‚Äù she stepped out of her hiding-place
and stood in curious dignity beside the water, her
hands folded in front of her on her black pleated sdk
apron ‚Äî ‚Äúat times, dear child, I long for company ‚Äî
earthly company.‚Äù She glanced furtively about her.
‚ÄúBut I must restrain my longings ; and you will, of
course, understand that I do not complain. He
knows best. And my dear cousin. Miss Coppin ‚Äî she
too knows best. She does not consider too much
companionship expedient for me.‚Äù She glanced in
some perplexity into the smoothly swirling water.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI, you know,‚Äù she said suddenly, raising her little
piercing eyes to mine, ‚ÄúI am Miss Duveen, that&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>MISS DUVEEN</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>they say, quite the thing here.‚Äù She tapped her small
forehead again beneath its two sleek curves of grey-
ing hair, and made a long narrow mouth at me.
‚ÄúThough, of course,‚Äù she added, ‚Äúwe do not tell her
so. No!‚Äù</p>
<p>And I, too, nodded my head in instinctive and
absorbed imitation. Miss Duveen laughed gaily.
‚ÄúHe understands, he understands !‚Äù she cried, as if
to many listeners. ‚ÄúOh, what a joy it is in this world,
Arthur, to be understood. Now tell me,‚Äù she con-
tinued with immense nicety, ‚Äútell me, how‚Äôs your
dear mamma?‚Äù</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAh,‚Äù she cried, ‚ÄúI see, I see ; Arthur has no
mamma. We wiU not refer to it. No father, either ?‚Äù</p>
<p>I shook my head again and, standing perfectly still,
stated at my new acquaintance with vacuous curios-
ity. She gazed at me with equal concentration, as if
she were endeavouring to keep the very thought of
my presence in her mind.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is sad to have no father,‚Äù she continued rapidly,
half closing her eyes ; ‚Äúno head, no guide, no stay,
no stronghold ; but we have, O yes, we have another
father, dear child, another father ‚Äî eh ? . . .Where
. . . Where ?‚Äù</p>
<p>She very softly raised her finger. ‚ÄúOn high,‚Äù she
whispered, with extraordinary intensity.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut just now,‚Äù she added cheerfully, hugging her
mittened hands together, ‚Äúwe are not talking of
liim ; we ate talking of ourselves, just you and me.
So cosy ; so secret ! And it‚Äôs a grandmother ? I
thought 80, 1 thought so, a grandmother 1 O yes, I</p>
<p>MISS DUVEEN</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>can peep between the curtains, though they do lock
the door. A grandmother ‚Äî thought so ; that very
droll old lady ! Such fine clothes I Such a presence,
oh yes ! A grandmother.‚Äù She poked out her chin
and laughed confidentially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the long, bony creature, all rub and double‚Äù
‚Äî she jogged briskly with her elbows, &ldquo;who‚Äôs that ?‚Äù</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Pridgett,‚Äù I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there,‚Äù she whispered breathlessly, gazing
widely about her. &ldquo;Think of that ! He knows ; He
understands. How firm, how manly, how un-
daunted ! . . . 0/te t ?‚Äô</p>
<p>I shook my head dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should he ?‚Äù she cried scornfully. But
between ourselves, Arthur, that is a thing we must
learn, and never mind the headache. We cannot, of
course, know everything. Even Miss Coppin does
not know everything ‚Äî ‚Äù she leaned forward with
intense earnestness ‚Äî ‚Äúthough I don‚Äôt tell her so.
We must try to learn all we can ; and at once. One
thing, dear child, you may be astonished to hear, I
learned only yesterday, and that is how exceedingly
sad life is.‚Äù</p>
<p>She leaned her chin upon her narrow bosom
pursing her lips. &ldquo;And yet you know they say very</p>
<p>litde about it They don‚Äôt mention it. Eveiy</p>
<p>moment, evety hour, every day, every year‚Äî one,
two, three, rour, five, seven, ten,‚Äù ‚Ä¢ she paused,
frowned, &ldquo;and so on. Sadder and sadder. Why ?
why ? It‚Äôs strange, but oh, so true. You really can
have no notion, child, how very sad I am myself at
times. In the evening, when they all gather togedier,</p>
<p>MISS DUVEEN</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>in their white raiment, up and up and up, I sit on the
garden seat, on Miss Coppin‚Äôs garden seat, and pre-
cisely in the middle (you‚Äôll be kind enough to re-
member that?) and my thoughts make me sad.‚Äù She
narrowed her eyes and shoulders. ‚ÄúYes and fright-
ened, my child ! Why must I be so guarded ? One
angel ‚Äî the greatest /oo/ could see the wisdom of that.
But billions ! ‚Äî with their fixed eyes shining, so very
.boldly, on me. I never prayed for so many, dear
friend. And we pray for a good many odd things,
you and I, I‚Äôll be bound. But, there, you see, poor
Miss Duveen‚Äôs on her theology again ‚Äî scamper,
scamper, scamper. In the congregations of the
wicked we must be cautious ! . . . Mrs. Partridge
and grandmamma, so nice, so nice ; but even that,
too, a little sad, eh ?‚Äù She leaned her head question-
ingly, like a starving bird in the snow.</p>
<p>I smiled, not knowing what else she expected of
me ; and her face became instantly grave and set.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs right ; perfectly right. We must speak evil
of w-one. No-one. We must shut our mouths.</p>
<p>We ‚Äù She stopped suddenly and, taking a step</p>
<p>leaned over the water towards me, with eyebrows
raised high above her tiny face. ‚ÄúS ‚Äî sb !‚Äù she
whispered, laying a long forefinger on her lips.
‚ÄúEavesdroppers !‚Äù she smoothed her skirts, straight-
ened her cap, and left me ; only a moment after to
poke out her head at me again from between the
leafy bushes. ‚ÄúAn assignation, no !‚Äù she said firmly,
then gathered her poor, cheerful, forlorn, crooked,
lovable face into a most wonderful contraction at me,
that assuredly meant ‚Äî ‚ÄúBut, jv/</p>
<p>MISS DUVEEN</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>Indeed it was an assignation, the first of how
many, and how few. Sometimes Miss Duvecn would
sit beside me, apparently so lost in thought that I v/as
clean forgotten. And yet I half fancied it was often
nothing but feigning. ‚ÄúOnce she stared me blankly
out of countenance when J ventured to take the
initiative and to call out Good-morning to her
across the water. On this occasion she completed
my consternation with a sudden, angry grimace ‚Äî
contempt, jealousy, outrage.</p>
<p>But often we met like old friends and talked. It was
a novel but not always welcome diversion for me in
the long shady garden that w&rsquo;as my privy universe.
Where our alders met, mingling their branches
across the flowing water, and the kingfisher might
be seen ‚Äî there was our usual tryst. But, occasionally,
at her invitation, I would venture across the
stepping-stones into her demesne ; and occasionally,
but very seldom indeed, she would venture into
mine. How plainly I see her, tip-toeing from stone
to stone, in an extraordinary concentration of mind
‚Äî her mulberr}&rsquo;^ petticoats, her white stockings, her
loose spring-side boots. And when at last she stood
beside me, her mittened hand on her breast, she would
laugh on in a kind of paroxysm until the tears stood in
her eyes, and she grew faint with breathlessness.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn all danger,‚Äù she told me once, ‚ÄúI hold my
breath and shut my eyes. And if I could tell you of
every danger, I think, perhaps, you would under-
stand dear Miss Coppin . &hellip;‚Äù I did not, and</p>
<p>jret, perhaps, very vaguely I did see the connection
in this rambling statement.</p>
<p>MISSDUVEEN 77</p>
<p>Like most children, I liked best to hear Miss
Duvecn talk about her own childhood. I contrived
somehow to discover that if we sat near flowers or
under boughs in blossom, her talk would generally
steal round to that. Then she would chatter on and
on : of the white sunny rambling house, somewhere,
nowhere ‚Äî it saddened and confused her if I asked
where‚Äî in which she had spent her first happy years;
where her father used to ride on a black horse ; and
her mother to walk with her in the garden in a crino-
lined gown and a locket w&rsquo;ith the painted miniature
of a ‚Äúdivine‚Äù nobleman inside it. How very far
away these pictures seenied !</p>
<p>It was as if she herself had shrunken back into this
distant past, and was babbling on like a child again,
already a little isolated by her tiny infirmity.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat was before ‚Äù she would begin to explain</p>
<p>precisely, and then a crisscross many-wrinlded frown
would net her rounded forehead, and cloud her eyes.
Time might baffle her, but then, time often baffled
me too. Any talk about her mother usually reminded
her of an elder sister, Caroline. ‚ÄúMy sister, Caroline,‚Äù
she would repeat as if by rote, ‚Äúyou may not be
aware, Arthur, was afterwards Mrs. Bute. So char-
ming, so exquisite, so accomplished. And Colonel
Bute ‚Äî an officer and a gentleman, I grant. And
yet . . . But no ! My dear sister was not happy.
And so it was no doubt a blessing in disguise that by
an unfortunate accident she was found drowned. In a
lake, you will understand, not a mere shallow noisy
brook. This is one of my private sorrows, which, of
course, your grandmamma would be horrified to heat</p>
<p>MISS DUVEEN</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>‚Äî horrified ; and which, of course. Partridge has not
the privilege of birth even to be informed of ‚Äî our
secret, dear child ‚Äî with all her beautiful hair, and
her elegant feet, and her eyes no more ajar than this ;
but blue, blue as the forget-me-not. When the time
comes. Miss Coppin will close my own eyes, I hope
and trust. Death, dear, dear child, I know t l^ say is
only sleeping. Yet I hope and trust that. &lsquo;‚ÄòTo be
sleeping wide awake ; oh no !‚Äù She abruptly turned
her small untidy head away.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut didn‚Äôt they shut hers ?‚Äù I enquired.</p>
<p>Miss Duveen ignored the question. ‚ÄúI am not
uttering one word of blame,‚Äù she went on rapidly; ‚ÄúI
am perfectly aware that such things confuse me. Miss
Coppin tells me not to think. She tells me that I can
have no opinions worth the mention. She says, ‚ÄòShut
up your mouth.‚Äô I must keep silence then. All that
I am merely trying to express to you, Arthur,
knowing you will regard it as sacred between us ‚Äî
all I am expressing is that my dear sister, Caroline,
was a gifted and beautiful creature with not a
shadow or vestige or tinge or taint of confusion in
her mind. &lsquo;Nothing. And yet, w&rsquo;hen they dragged her
out of the water and laid her there on the bank, look-
ing ‚Äî ‚Äô‚ÄôShe stooped herself double in a sudden dread-
ful fit of gasping, and I feared for an instant she was
about to die.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo, no, no,‚Äù she cried, rocking herself to and
fro, ‚Äúyou shall not paint such a picture in his young,
innocent mind. You shall not.‚Äù</p>
<p>I sat on my stone, watching her, feeling excessively
uncomfortable. ‚ÄúBut what did she look like. Miss</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>MISS DU VEEN</p>
<p>Duvecn ?‚Äù I pressed forward to ask at last.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo, no, no,‚Äù she cried again. ‚ÄúCast him out,
cast him out. Ketro Sathanas I We must not even
ask to understanci. My father and my dear mother,</p>
<p>I do not doubt, have spoken for Caroline. Even I,
if I must be called on, will strive to collect my
thou^m^ And that is precisely where a friend, you,
Arthur, would be so precious ; to know that you too,
in your innocence, will be helping me to collect my
thoughts on that day, to save our dear Caroline from
Everlasting Anger. That, that! Oh dear: oh dear!‚Äù
She turned on me a face I should scarcely have recog-
nised, lifted herself trembling to her feet, and hurried
away.</p>
<p>Sometimes it was not Miss Duveen that was a
child again, but I that had grown up. ‚ÄúHad now you
been your handsome father ‚Äî and I see him , O, so
plainly, dear child ‚Äî had you been your father, then
I must, of course, have kept to the house &hellip; I
must have ; it is a rule of conduct, and everything
depends on them. Where would Society be else ?‚Äù
she cried, with an unanswerable blaze of intelligence.
‚ÄúI find, too, dear Arthur, that they increase ‚Äî ^the
rules increase. I try to remember them. My dear
cousin. Miss Coppin, knows them all. But I ‚Äî
think sometimes one‚Äôs memory is a little treacherous.
And then it must vex people.‚Äù</p>
<p>She gazed penetratingly at me for an answer tihat
did not come. Mute as a fish though I might be, I
suppose it was something of a comfort to her to t^k
tome.</p>
<p>And to suppose that is my one small crumb of</p>
<p>MISS DUVEEN</p>
<p>8o</p>
<p>comfort when I reflect on the kind of friendship I
managed to bestow.</p>
<p>I actually met Miss Coppin once ; but we did not
speak. I had, in fact, gone to tea with Miss Duveen.
The project had been discussed as ‚Äúquite, quite im-
possible, dear child‚Äù for weeks. ‚ÄúYou must never
mention it again.‚Äù As a matter of fact I &lsquo;^tt^never
mentioned it at all. But one day ‚Äî possiWy when
their charge had been less difficult and exacting, one
day Miss Coppin and her gaunt maid-servant and&rdquo;
companion really did go out together, leaving Miss
Duveen alone in WiUowlea. It was the crowning
opportunity of our friendship. The moment I espied
her issuing from the house, I guessed her errand.
She came hastening down to the waterside, attired
in clothes of a colour and fashion I had never seen
her wearing before, her dark eyes shining in her head,
her hands trembling with excitement.</p>
<p>It was a still, warm afternoon, with Sweet Williams
and linden and stocks scenting the air, when, with
some Little trepidation, I must confess, I followed her
in formal dignity up the unfamiliar path towards the
house. I know not which of our hearts beat the
quicker, whose eyes cast the most furtive glances
about us. My friend‚Äôs cheeks were brightest mauve J
She wore a large silver locket on a ribbon ; and 1
followed her up the faded green stairs, beneath the
dark pictures, to her small, stuffy bedroom under
the roof. We humans, they say, are gflygJa|wd¬´in a</p>

<ul>
<li>‚Äî j</li>
</ul>
<p>t&lt;aa:aiioJy.je^tce^ 4rMe,iMiUve. Nevertheless, there was
an air, an atmosphere as of the smell of peats in this</p>
<p>MISSDUVEEN 8l</p>
<p>email attic room ‚Äî well, every bird, I suppose, haunts
with its presence its customary cage.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis,‚Äù she said, acknowledging the bed, the
looking-glass, the deal washstand, ‚Äúthis, dear child,
you will pardon ; in fact, you will not see. How
could we sit, friends as we are, in the congregation
of stipi^i^rs ?‚Äù</p>
<p>I hardly know why, but that favourite word of
Miss Duveen‚Äôs, ‚Äúcongregation,‚Äù brought up before
me with extreme aversion all the hostile hardness and
suspicion concentrated in Miss Coppin and Ann. I
stared at the queer tea things in a vain effort not to be
aware of the test of Miss Duveen‚Äôs private belongings.</p>
<p>Somehow or other she had managed to procure for
me a bun ‚Äî a saffron bun. There was a dish of a gray
pudding and a plate of raspberries that I could not
help suspecting (and, I am ashamed to say, with
aggrieved astonishment), she must have herself
gathered that morning from my grandmother‚Äôs canes.
We did not talk very much. Her heart gave her pain.
And her face showed how hot and absorbed and
dismayed she was over her foolhardy entertainment.
But I sipped my milk and water, sitting on a black
bandbox, and she on an old cane chair. And we
were almost formal and distant to one another, with
little smiles and curtseys over our cups, and polished
agreement about the weather.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôll strive not to be sick, dear child,‚Äù she
implored me suddenly, while I was nibbling my way
slowly through the bun. But it was not until rumours
of the tremendous fact of Miss Coppin‚Äôs early and
unforeseen return had been borne in on us that Miss</p>
<p>MISS DOVEEN</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>Duvecn lost all presence of mind. She burst into
tears ; seized and kissed repeatedly my sticky hands ;
implored me to be discreet ; implored me to be
gone ; implored me to retain her in my affections,
‚Äúas you love your poor dear mother, Arthur,‚Äù and I
left her on her knees, her locket pressed to her bosom.</p>
<p>Miss Coppin was, I think, unusually astoiin^d to
see a small strange boy walk softly past her be^oom
door, within which she sat, with purple face, her hat
strings dangling, taking off her boots. Ann, I am
thankful to say, I did not encounter. But when I was
safely out in the garden in the afternoon sunshine, the
boldness and the romance of this sally completely de-
serted me. I ran like a hare down the alien path, leapt
from stone to stone across the river ; nor paused in
my flight until I was safe in my own bedroom, and
had ‚Äî how odd is childhood ! ‚Äî washed my face and
entirely changed my clothes.</p>
<p>My grandmother, when I appeared at her tea-table,
glanced at me now and again rather profoundly and
inquisitively, but the actual question hovering in her
mind remained unuttered.</p>
<p>It was many days before we met again, my friend
and I. She had, I gathered from many mysterious
nods and shrugs, been more or less confined to her
bedroom ever since our escapade, and looked dulled
and anxious ; her small face was even a little more
vacant in repose than usual. Even this meeting, too,
was full of alarms ; for in the midst of out talk, by mere
chance or caprice, my grandmother took a walk in the
garden that afternoon, and discovered us under our
damson tree. She bowed in her dignified, aged way.</p>
<p>MISS DUVEEN 85</p>
<p>And Miss Duveen, with cheeks and forehead the
colour of her petticoat, elaborately curtseyed.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBeautiful, very beautiful weather,‚Äù said my
grandmother.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is, indeed,‚Äù said my friend, fixedly.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI trust you are keeping pretty w&rsquo;eU ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs,fer, Ma‚Äôam, as God and a little weakness of
the hetft permit,‚Äù said Miss Duveen. ‚ÄúHe knows
all,‚Äù she added, firmly</p>
<ul>
<li>My grandmother stood silent a moment.</li>
</ul>
<p>‚ÄúIn^ed he does,‚Äù she replied politely.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs the difficulty,‚Äù ventured Miss Duveen,
in her odd, furtive, friendly fashion.</p>
<p>My grandmother opened her eyes, smiled plea-
santly, paused, glanced remotely at me, and, with
another exchange of courtesies. Miss Duveen and I
were left alone once more. But it was a grave and
saddened friend I now sat beside.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou see, Arthur, all bad things, we know, are
best for us. Motives included. That comforts me.
But my heart is sadly fluttered. Not that I fear or
would shun society ; but perhaps your grandmother
&hellip; I never had the power to treat my fellow-creat-
ures as if they were stocks and stones. And the effort
not to notice it distresses me. A litde hartshorn
might relieve the palpitation, of course ; but Miss
Coppin keeps all keys. It is this shouting that makes
civility such a task.‚Äù</p>
<p>This shouting‚Äù ‚Äî very faintly then I caught her
meaning, but I was in no mood to sympathise. My
grandmother‚Äôs one round-eyed expressionless glance
at me had been singularly disconcerting. And it was</p>
<p>84 MISSDUVEEN</p>
<p>only apprehension of her questions that kept me
from beating a retreat. So we sat on. Miss Duveen
and I, in the shade, the day drawing towards evenings
and presently we walked down to the water-side, and
under the colours of simset I flung in my crumbs to
the minnows, as she talked ceaselessly on.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd yet,‚Äù she concluded, after how inyplved a
monologue, ‚Äúand yet, Arthur, I feel it is for your
forgiveness I should be pleading. So much to do ;
such an arch of beautiful things might have been my
gift to you. It is here,‚Äù she said, touching her fore-
head. ‚ÄúI do not think, perhaps, that all I might say
would be for your good. I must be silent and dis-
creet about much. I must not provoke‚Äù ‚Äî she lifted
her mittened finger, and raised her eyes ‚Äî ‚ÄúThem,‚Äù
she said gravely. ‚ÄúI am tempted, terrified, persecuted.
Whispering, wrangling, shouting : the flesh is a
grievous burden, Arthur ; I long for peace. Only
to flee away and be at rest ! But,‚Äù she nodded, and
glanced over her shoulder, ‚Äúabout much ‚Äî ^great
trials, sad entanglements, about much the Others say,
I must keep silence. It would only alarm your in-
nocence. And that I will never, do. Your father,</p>
<p>a noble, gallant gentleman of the world, would have
understood my difficulties. But he is dead . . . .
Whatever that may mean. I have repeated it so ofte^
when Miss Coppin thought that I was not ‚Äî dead,
dead, dead, dead ‚Äî but I don‚Äôt think that even now
I grasp the meaning of the word. Of you, dear child,
I will never say it. You have been life itself to me.‚Äù</p>
<p>How generously, how tenderly she smiled on me
from her perplexed, sorrowful eyes.</p>
<p>MISS DUVEEK</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou have all the world before you, all the world.
How splendid it is to be a Man. For my part I have
sometimes thought, though they do not of course
intend to injure me, yet I fancy, sometimes, they
have grudged me my part in it a little. Though God
forbid but Heaven‚Äôs best.‚Äù</p>
<p>She raised that peering, dark, remote gaze to my
face, and her head was trembling again. ‚ÄúThey
are saying now to one another ‚Äî ^Where is she ?
where is she ? It&rsquo;s nearly dark, m&rsquo;m, where is she ?&rsquo; O,
Arthur, but there shall be no night there. We must
believe it, we must ‚Äî in spite, dear friend, of a weak
horror of glare. My cousin. Miss Coppin, does not
approve of my wishes. Gas, gas, gas, all over the
house, and when it is not singing, it roars. You would
suppose I might be trusted with but just my own one
bracket. But no ‚Äî Ann, I think ‚Äî indeed I fear,</p>
<p>sometimes, has no ‚Äù She started violently and</p>
<p>shook her tiny head. ‚ÄúWhen I am gone,‚Äù she con-
tinued disjointedly, ‚Äúyou will be prudent, cautious,
dear child ? Consult only your heart about me.
Older you must be . . . Yes, certainly, he must be
older,‚Äù she repeated vaguely. ‚ÄúEverything goes on
and on ‚Äî and round !‚Äù She seemed astonished, as if
at a sudden radiance cast on an old and protracted
perplexity.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAbout your soul, dear child,‚Äù she said to me
once, touching my hand, ‚ÄúI have never spoken.
[Perhaps it was one of my first duties to keep on
[Speaking to you about your soul. I mention it now
jilt case they should rebuke me when I make my
la^ppcarancc there. It is a burden ; and I have so many</p>
<p>MISS DUVEEN</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>burdens, as well as pain. And at times I cannot
think very far. I see the thought; but it won‚Äôt alter.
It comes back, just like a sheep -‚ÄòBa-aa-aby‚Äô like
that I‚Äù She burst out laughing, twisting her head to
look at me the while. ‚ÄúMiss Coppin, of course, has
no difficulty ; gentlemen have no difficulty. And this
shall be the occasion of another of our little con-
fidences. We are discreet ?‚Äù She bent her head and
scanned my face. ‚ÄúHere,‚Äù she tapped her bosom,_
‚ÄúI bear his image. My only dear one‚Äôs. And if you
would kindly turn your head, dear child, perhaps
I could pull him out.‚Äù</p>
<p>It was the miniature of a young, languid, fas-
tidious-looking officer which she showed me ‚Äî
threaded on dmgy tape, in its tarnished locket.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMiss Coppin, in great generosity, has left me
this,‚Äù she said, polishing the glass on her knee,
‚Äúthough I am forbidden to wear it. For you see,
Arthur, it is a duty not to brood on the past, and even
j perhaps, indelicate. Some day, it may be, you, too,
jf win love a gentle girl. I beseech you, keep your
I heart pure and true. TJiia-ofle-could not. Not a
&rsquo; single word of blame escapes me. I own to my Maker,
never to anyone else, it has not eased my Little difficulty.
But it is not for us to judge. Whose office is that,
eh ?‚Äù And again, that lean small fore-finger, beneath
an indescribable grimace, pointed gently, deliberately,
from her lap upward. ‚ÄúPray, pray,‚Äù she added*
very violently, ‚Äúpray, tiU the blood streams dowfi
your face ! Pray, but rebuke not. They aU whispek
about it. Among themselves,‚Äù she addcd,pecring owt
beneath and betwe¬´i the interlacing branches. ‚ÄúBu t</p>
<p>MISS DUVEEN</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>I simulate inattention. I simulate. . .‚Äù The very phrase
seemed to have hopelessly confused her. Again, as
so often now, that glassy fear came into her eyes ;
her foot tapped on the gravel.</p>
<p>‚ÄúArthur,‚Äù she cried suddenly, taking my hand
tightly in her lap, ‚Äúyou have been my refuge in a
time of trouble. You will never know it, child. My
refuge, and my peace. We shall seldom meet now.
All are opposed. They repeat it in their looks. The
Autumn will divide us ; and then, Winter ; but, I
think, no Spring. It is so, Arthur, there is a stir ;
and then they will hunt me out.‚Äù Her eyes gleamed
again, far and small and black in the dusky pallor of
her face.</p>
<p>It was indeed already Autumn ; the air golden and
still. The leaves were beginning to fall. The late
fruits were well-nigh over. Robins and tits seemed
our only birds now. Rain came in floods. The
Wandle took sound and volume, sweeping deep
above our stepping stones. Very seldom after this I
even so much as saw our neighbour. I chanced on
her one still afternoon, standing fixedly by the braw-
ling stream, in a rusty-looking old-fashioned cloak,
her scanty hair pushed high up on her forehead.</p>
<p>She stared at me for a moment or two, and then,
with a scared look over her shoulder, threw me a
little letter, shaped like a cock-hat, and weighted with
a pebble stone, across the stream. She whispered
earnestly and rapidly at me over the water. But I
could not catch a single word she said, and failed to
decipher her close spidery handwriting. No doubt
I was too shy, or too ashamed, or in a vague fashion</p>
<p>MISS DUVEEN</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>too loyal, to show it to my grandmother. It is not
now a flattering keepsake. I called out loudly I must
go in ; and stiU see her gazing after me, with a puz-
zled, mournful expression on the face peering out
of the cloak.</p>
<p>Even after that w&rsquo;e sometimes waved to one an-
other across the water, but never if by hiding myself
I could evade her in time. The distance seemed to
confuse h^er, and quite silenced me. I began to see
we were ridiculous friends, especially as she came‚Äô
now in ever dingier and absurder clothes. She even
looked hungry, and not quite dean, as well as ill ;
and she talked more to her phantoms than to me
when once we met.</p>
<p>The first ice w^as in the garden. The trees stood
bare beneath a pale blue sunny sky, and I was stand-
ing at the window‚Äô, looking out at the hoar-frost,
when my grandmother told me that it was unlikely
that I shoidd ever see our neighbour again.</p>
<p>I stood where I was, without turning round,
staring out of the window at the motionless ghostly
trees, and the few birds in forlorn unease.</p>
<p>‚ÄòTs she dead, then ?‚Äù I enquired.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am told,‚Äù was the reply, ‚Äúthat her friends have
been compelled to have her put away. No doubt, it
was the proper course. It should have been done
earlier. But it is not our affair, you are to under-
stand. And, poor creature, perhaps death would
have been a happier, a more merciful release. She was
sadly afflicted.‚Äù</p>
<p>I said nothing, and continued to stare out of the
window.</p>
<p>MISS DUVEEN</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>But I know now that the news, in spite of a vague
sorrow, greatly relieved me. I should be at ease in
the garden again, came the thought ‚Äî no longer fear
to look ridiculous, and grow hot when our neigh-
bour was mentioned, or be saddled with her com-
pany beside the stream.</p>
<p>SELINA‚ÄôS PARABLE</p>
<p>O N the wide wooden staircase that led up to her
big sea-windy bedroom in the old house in
which Sehna was staying was a low, square
window. For Selina, every window in her small pri-
vate world had a charm, an incantation all its own.
Was it not an egress for her eye to a scene of some
beauty, or life, or of forbiddingness ; was it not the
way of light ; either her own outward, or the world‚Äôs
inward ? This small v/indow in particular beguiled
Selina, because, kneeling there (it was oi too narrow
a frame to permit a protracted standing or stooping)
she looked out of it, and down from it, upon a farm-
yard. Sehna knew farmyards that more seductively
soothed her jcsthctic sense ‚Äî farmyards of richer ricks,
of solider outbuildings, of a deeper peace. But since
this farmyard, despite its litter and bareness, was
busy with life ‚Äî dog in kennel, chicken, duck, goose,
gander and goslings, doves, a few wild birds, some
even of the sea, an occasional horse and man ‚Äî con-
templation of it solaced her small mind, keeping it
gently busy, and yet in a state narrowly bordenng
on trance.</p>
<p>Selina was dark and narrow-shouldered, with eyes
of so intense a brown that, when the spirit that lurked
behind them was absorbed in what they gazed on,
they were like two small black pools of water. And
one long, warm, languorous Jifternoon she found
herself kneeling once again at the low staircase win-
dow even more densely engrossed than usual. At
the bottom of the farmyard, perhaps twenty paces</p>
<p>Selina‚Äôs parable&rsquo; 91</p>
<p>distant, stood a low stone barn or granary, its square
door opening blackly into the sunlight upon a night
of, maybe, ten rough and weed-tousled stone steps.
Beyond its roof stretched the green dreaming steeps
of the valley. From this door, it was the farmer‚Äôs
wont, morning and evening, to feed his winged stock.</p>
<p>On this particular afternoon the hour was but
hard on four. Something unusual was afoot. Selina
watched the farmer ponderously traverse the yard,
and, in his usual stout Alcxander-Selkirkian fashion,
ascend into the granary. Surely not thus unseasonably
to dispense the good grain, but for some purpose or
purposes unknown ‚Äî unknown at least to Selina.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, all his chickens, such is faith, instinct,
habit and stupidity, had followed close upon his
heels, and were now sleekly and expectantly clust-
ered in mute concourse upon the steps and on the
adjacent yard-stones, precisely like an assemblage of
humanity patiently waiting to be admitted into the
pit of a theatre or into the nave of a church.</p>
<p>There was a dramatic pause. The sun shone on.
The blue seemed to deepen. A few late-comets
flurried in from the byways and hedges. The rest of
the congregation was steadfast ‚Äî with just a feverish
effort apparent here and there of some one jealous
individual to better her position at the expense of
those more favourably situated. Then, after a pro-
longed interval, the square door was reopened, and
the farmer emerged, empty-handed and apparently
unconscious of the expectant assemblage awaiting
him. Without so much as a glance of compassion or
even of heed, he trod heavily down the stone steps</p>
<p>92 seiina‚Äôs parable</p>
<p>through the assembled hens, careless to all appear-
ance whether his swinging, cumbrous boots trod the
more eager underfoot, and ‚Äî wonder of wonders ! ‚Äî
he left the door behind him, and at its very fullest gape.</p>
<p>Selina sighed : the happiest of sighs, that of expec-
tation and forbidden delight. It was as if the com-
missionaire of the theatre or the gaitered archdeacon
of the cathedral had simply betrayed his edifice, and
its treasures, to the mob. God bless me, thought
Selina, they‚Äôll go in and help themselves !</p>
<p>Only one moiety of this brilliant speculation of
Selina‚Äôs was to be proved justified. Led by a remark-
ably neat jimp blue-black I.eghorn hen, deliciously
feminine and adventurous, churchwarden‚Äôs helpmeet
if ever there was one, the whole feathered mob, as if
under the gesture of a magician, with an instantan-
eous and soundless ingurgitation of appetite and
desire, swept upward and in. Threescore hens at
least were there, the appropriate leaven of cocks, two
couple of ducks, three doves, a few predatory wild-
ings, while the little cluster of geese on the outskirts
outstretched their serpentine necks and hissed.</p>
<p>Selina, transfixed there in a felicity bordering upon
rapture, watched. Like Athene above the plains of
Troy, she gathered in her slim shoulders as if to
swoop. What was happening within, beyond that
strange square of velvety afternoon darkness ? The
rapine, the orgy, the indiscriminate gorge ? Alas, no 1
Whether or not the marauders had discerned or even
so much as descried the fatted bags of oats and make
and wheat that were undoubtedly shelved within that
punctual hostel, Selina could not guess. This only was</p>
<p>Selina‚Äôs parable^ 93</p>
<p>perfectly plain ‚Äî that the concourse was now dejec-
tedly emerging, dispirited and unfed. One by one, in
ruffled groups, peevish, crestfallen, damped, the
feathered congregation by ones and twos and threes
reappeared, trod, or hopped, or fluttered down the
shallow familiar disenchanted steps, the ducks, too,
dumb and ignoble, the cocks simulating indifference
or contempt, the wildings ‚Äî as wild as ever.</p>
<p>When Selina, stiU agape, came to herself, the farm-
yard was much as usual ‚Äî dispersed clusters of huffed,
short-memoried and dusting fowl, a pacing cock, the
dog, head on paws, still asleep, doves in compara-
tively dispassionate courtship on the roof, duck and
^ake guzzling in that unfathomable morass of in-
iquity known as the duck pond.</p>
<p>‚ÄúCame to herself‚Äù ‚Äî ^for Selina‚Äôs was a type of
mind that cannot but follow things up (as far as ever
she could go) ; it was compelled, that is, by sheet
natural impulse, to spin queer little stories out of the
actual, and even, alas, to moralise.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy,‚Äù she mused, ‚Äúpoor hen-brained things,
they came to be fed. Always when the farmer opened
the door and went in, grain, the bread of life, came
out. Always. And he, surely, being a more or less
generous creature, capable at any moment of mag-
nanimity, and not, gracious goodness, a cold and
bloated cynic, since one must at least, think the best of
what is and may be, why, of course, they simply could
not but go in, as they did, and, to say the least of it,
just see for themselves. You surely can‚Äôt impiously
laid the Qvtn, Morning, and possibly afternoon, the
poor creatures as best their natural powers allow.</p>
<p>94 selina‚Äôsparable</p>
<p>reward the farmer for his benefactions. A little in-
directly, perhaps, but surely you wouldn‚Äôt expect the
poor things to reason that he gives ‚Äî well, what he
does give ‚Äî solely for gain, that his bounty is sheer
profiteering, that it is their eggs, their poor carcases,
or their positive offspring he is after, for his own ‚Äî
well, to them ‚Äî immeasurably barbarous purposes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSuppose with avid beak (a little magnified, of
course) they surge in one day and carry off his last .
squalling baby ‚Äî that puffy little Samuel ‚Äî from his
cradle. Suppose they do. It will serve him right :
it will be tit for tat. They had believed in him ‚Äî that
was the point. Now they won‚Äôt : they can&rsquo;t ‚Äî at least
not for ten minutes. Though they are always hungry.
Yes, they had climbed up, lured on by sheer indiffer-
ence masquerading as generosity, in the heat of the
day, too, and that peculiarly slim and gimp black
Leghorn pullet in particular, only to discover ‚Äî
nothing, just cool inner darkness and odoriferous
vacancy. Even a horny, fussy old verger would at
least have shooed them out again, have told them
that they had made a mistake, that there wasn‚Äôt any
extra thing ‚Äòon‚Äô of that kind ‚Äî no confirmation service,
you know.‚Äù And Selina fleetingly smiled, narrow
cheek, delicate lip, and black abstracted eye.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHow very like poor human beings,‚Äù she went on,
pursuing her small privy thoughts, slipping down,
as she did so, from kneeling to sitting, and auto-
matically readjusting the tortoiseshell comb in her
dark hair ; ‚Äúpunctually they go to church (some of
them), not attempting to guess, or not capable, I
suppose, of really knowings what for ; but confident</p>
<p>SELIN a‚Äôs parable&rsquo; 95</p>
<p>that the bishop or rector or somebody will be in the
pulpit and they be fed.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd then comes a day ‚Äî Now what is the differ-
ence,‚Äù mused Selina, contemplatively narrowing her
inward gaze, ‚Äúwhat is the real difference between
Farmer Trepolpen and God, and between that fussy,
forward ‚Äî still she was adventurous ‚Äî litde Leghorn,
who must lay the most delicious little cream-coloured
eggs, and Me ? Surely no : He cannot want me (He
cannot expect me to go to church and praise and pray)
simply for the sake of my wretched little hard-boiled
bits of goodness. Does He really only think of us
twice in twenty-four hours, like the tides, like matins
and evensong, as ‚Äî well, as I think of Him ?</p>
<p>And if in between- whiles He did think of me or I of
Him, isn‚Äôt there any inexhaustible store of heavenly
manna which my trussed-up soul ‚Äî and I suppose the
others ‚Äî though I wouldn‚Äôt mind the doves and the
sea-gull or &hellip; . Oh dear, oh dear 1‚Äù</p>
<p>Selina stared sofdy on, down the sunlit and in-
tensely still staircase into the shadow. ‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù
began again that stUl small voice within in far-away
tones, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not quite like that, it‚Äôs mf on all fours.
It‚Äôs a bigger dream than that. If they, siUy cackling
creatures, mercifully don‚Äôt know what that carniv-
orous old egg-hunter is after, I‚Äôm pretty certain he
doesn‚Äôt know eventually himself. Merely keeping
them alive : though that‚Äôs something. But not the
other. Anyhow, suppose, just suppose not. Suppose
there‚Äôs someone, a l^d of unseen circumspectious
spirit, kneeling crunched-up there at a litde square
staircase window. Oh, ever so happy and dreamy and</p>
<p>96 ‚ÄòSELINA*S PARABLE</p>
<p>sorro&rsquo;wful and alone, and not in the least muddle-
minded ‚Äî omniscient, I suppose, though that, of
course, must be omni ‚Äî omni-sensitive, too ‚Äî just
staring down in sheer joy and interest at the farmer,
and the sunshine, and the valley, and the yard, and
the hens, and that delicious filthy duck-pond and ‚Äî
and the Atlantic, absolutely all Its, and . . . What
wouldn‚Äôt I. . . , ?‚Äù</p>
<p>But at that moment, and only just in time to dis-
sever the philosophical net in which poor Selina‚Äôs
soul was definitely strangling, a whiff of hot baked
‚Äúsplitters‚Äù wafted itself up the staircase, and Selina
with an exclamatory ‚ÄúLawks 1‚Äù and a thin flying
hand flung up once more to her tortoiseshell comb,
remembered her tea.</p>
<p>SEATON‚ÄôS AUNT</p>
<p>1 HAD heard rumours of Seaton‚Äôs Aunt long before
I actually encountered her. Seaton, in the hush
of confidence, or at any little show of toleration
on our part, would remark, ‚ÄúMy aunt,‚Äù or ‚ÄúMy old
aunt, you know,‚Äù as if his relative might be a kind of
cement to an entente cordiale.</p>
<p>He had an unusual quantity of pocket-money ; or,
at any rate, it was bestowed on him in unusually
large amounts ; and he spent it freely, though none
of us would have described him as an ‚Äúawfully
generous chap.‚Äù ‚ÄúHuUo, Seaton,‚Äù we would say,
‚Äúthe old Begum ?‚Äù At the beginning of term, too,
he used to bring back surprising and exotic dainties
in a box with a trick padlock that accompanied him
from his first appearance at Gummidge‚Äôs in a billy-
cock hat to the rather abrupt conclusion of his
schooldays.</p>
<p>From a boy‚Äôs point of view he looked distastefully
foreign, with his yellow skin, and slow chocolate-
coloured eyes, and lean weak figure. Merely for
his looks he was treated by most of us true-blue
Englishmen with condescension, hostility, or con-
tempt. We used to call him ‚ÄúPongo,‚Äù but without
anjr much better excuse for the nickname than his
skin. He was, that is, in one sense of the term what
he assuredly was not in the other sense, a sport.</p>
<p>Seaton and I, as I may say, were never in any
sense intimate at school ; our orbits only intersected
in class. I kept deliberately aloof from him. I felt
vaguely he was a sneak, and remained quite un-</p>
<p>98 seaton‚Äôsaunt</p>
<p>mollified by advances on his side, which, in a
boy‚Äôs barbarous fashion, unless it suited me to be
magnanimous, I haughtily ignored.</p>
<p>We were both of us quick-footed, and at Prisoner‚Äôs
Base used occasionally to hide together. And so I
best remember Seaton ‚Äî his narrow watchful face in
the dusk of a summer evening ; his peculiar crouch,
and his inarticulate whisperings and mumblings.
Otherwise he played all games slackly and limply ;
used to stand and feed at his locker with a crony or
two until his ‚Äútuck‚Äù gave out ; or wastf* his money
on some outlandish fancy or other. He bought, for
instance, a silver bangle, which he wore above his
left elbow, until some of the fellows showed their
masterly contempt of the practice by dropping it
nearly red-hot down his neck.</p>
<p>It needed, therefore, a rather peculiar taste, a rather
rare kind of schoolboy courage and indifference to
criticism, to be much associated with him. And I had
neither the taste nor, perhaps, the courage. None
the less, he did make advances, and on one memorable
occasion went to the length of bestowing on me a
whole pot of some outlandish mulberry-coloured jelly
that had been duplicated in his term‚Äôs supplies. In
the exuberance or my gratitude I promised to spend
the next half-term hoHday with him at his aunt‚Äôs
house.</p>
<p>I had clean forgotten my promise when, two Of
three days before the holiday, he came up and
triumphantly reminded me of it.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWell, to tell you the honest truth, Seaton, old
chap‚Äî‚Äù I began graciously : but he cut me stoitt</p>
<p>seaton‚Äôsaunt 99</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy aunt expects you,‚Äù he said ; ‚Äúshe is very glad
you are coming. She‚Äôs sure to be quite decent to
you. Withers.‚Äù</p>
<p>I looked at him in sheer astonishment ; the
emphasis was so uncalled for. It seemed to suggest
an aunt not hitherto hinted at, and a friendly feeling
on Seaton‚Äôs side that was far more disconcerting
than welcome.</p>
<p>We reached his home partly by train, partly by a
lift in an empty farm-cart, and partly by walking. It
was a whole-day holiday, and we were to sleep the
night ; he lent me extraordinary night-gear, I
remember. The village street was unusually wide,
and was fed from a green by two converging roads,
with an inn, and a high green sign at the cornet.
About a hundred yards down the street was a chem-
ist‚Äôs shop ‚Äî a Mr. Tanner‚Äôs. We descended the two
steps into his dusky and odorous interior to buy, I
remember, some rat poison. A little beyond the
chemist‚Äôs was the forge. You then walked along a
very narrow path, under a fairly high wall, nodding
here and there with weeds and tufts of grass, and so
came to the iron garden-gates, and saw the high flat
house behind its huge sycamore. A coach-house
stood on the left of the house, and on the right a gate
led into a kind of rambling orchard. The lawn lay
away over to the left again, and at the bottom (for
the whole Mrden sloped gently to a sluggish and
rushy pond^ke stream) was a meadow.</p>
<p>We arrived at noon, and entered the gates out of
the hot dust beneath the glitter of the dark-curtained</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>Seaton‚Äôs aunt</p>
<p>windows. Seaton led me at once through the little
gMden-gate to show me his tadpole pond, swarming
with what (being myself not in the least interested in
low life) I considered the most horrible creatures ‚Äî
of all shapes, consistencies, and sizes, but with whom
Seaton seemed to be on the most intimate of terms.
I can see his absorbed face now as he sat on his heels
and fished the slimy things out in his sallow palms.
Weaiying at last of these pets, we loitered about
awhile in an aimless fashion. Seaton seemed to be
listening, or at any rate waiting, for sc nething to
happen or for someone to come. But nothing did
happen and no one came.</p>
<p>That was just like Seaton. Anyhow, the first
view I got of his aunt was when, at the summons of
a distant gong, we turned from the garden, very
hungry and thirsty, to go into luncheon. We were
approaching the house when Seaton suddenly came
to a standstill. Indeed, I have always had the
impression that he plucked at my sleeve. Some-
thing, at least, seemed to catch me back, as were, as
he cried, ‚ÄúLook out, there she is !‚Äù</p>
<p>She was standing at an upper window which
opened wide on a hinge, and at first sight she looked
an excessively tall and overwhelming figure. This,
however, was mainly because the window reached all
but to the floor of her bedroom. She was in reality
rather an under-sized woman, in spite of her long
face and big head. She must have stood, I rhinic,
unusually still, with eyes fixed on us, though thic
impression may be due to Seaton‚Äôs sudden warning
and to my consciousness of the cautious and subdnra</p>
<p>SEATON‚ÄôS AUNT ‚Ä¢ lOt:</p>
<p>ait that had fallen on him at sight of her. I know that
without the least reason in the world I felt a kind of
guiltiness, as if I had been ‚Äúcaught.‚Äù There was a
silvery star pattern sprinkled on her black silk dress,
and even from the ground I could see the immense
coils of her hair and the rings on her left hand which
was held fingering the small jet buttons of her bodice.
She watched our united advance without stirring,
until, imperceptibly, her eyes raised and lost them-
selves in the distance, so that it was out of an assumed
reverie that she appeared suddenly to awaken to our
presence beneath her when we drew close to the
house.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo this is your friend, Mr. Smithers, I suppose ?‚Äù
she said, bobbing to me.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWithers, aunt,‚Äù said Seaton.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs much the same,‚Äù she said, with eyes fixed on
me. ‚ÄúCome in, Mr. Withers, and bring him along
with you.‚Äù</p>
<p>She continued to gaze at me ‚Äî at least, I think she
did so. I know that the fixity of her scrutiny and her
ironical ‚ÄúMr.‚Äù made me feel peculiarly tmeomfort-
able. None the less she was extremely kind and
attentive to me, though, no doubt, her Hndness and
attention showed up more vividly against her com-
plete neglect of Seaton. Only one remark that I have,
any recollection of she made to him : ‚ÄúWhen I lor
on my nephew, Mr. Smithers, I realise that dus&rsquo;
are, and dust shall become. You are hot, dir
incorrigible, Arthur.‚Äù</p>
<p>She sat at the head of the table, Seaton
and I, before a wide waste of dama.*&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>102 SEATON ‚ÄôS AUNT</p>
<p>between them. It was an old and father close
dining-room, with windows thrown wide to the
green garden and a wonderfal cascade of fading
roses. Miss Seaton‚Äôs great chair faced this window,
so that its rose-reflected light shone full on her
yellowish face, and on just such chocolate eyes as my
schoolfellow‚Äôs, except that hers were more than half-
covered by unusually long and heavy lids.</p>
<p>There she sat, steadily eating, with those sluggish
eyes fixed for the most part on my face ; above them
stood the deep-lined fork between her eyebrows ;
and above that the wide expanse of a remarkable
brow beneath its strange steep bank of hair. The
lunch was copious, and consisted, I remember, of
all such dishes as arc generally considered too
rich and too good for the schoolboy digestion ‚Äî
lobster mayonnaise, cold game sausages, an immense
veal and ham pie farced with eggs, truffles, and
numberless delicious flavours ; besides kickshaws,
creams and sweetmeats. We even had wine, a half-
glass of old darkish sherry each.</p>
<p>Miss Seaton enjoyed and indulged an enormous
appetite. Her example and a natural schoolboy
voracity soon overcame my nervousness of her, even
to the extent of allowing me to enjoy to the best of my
bent so rare a spread. Seaton was singularly
&lsquo;&gt;dest ; the greater part of his meal consisted of
‚ñ†‚Äònds and raisins, which he nibbled surreptitiously
‚ÄôThe found difficulty in swallowing them.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ mean that Miss Seaton ‚Äúconversed‚Äù with
merely scattered trenchant remarks and
n twinkled a baited question over my</p>
<p>Seaton‚Äôs AUNT 103</p>
<p>head. But her face was like a dense and involved
accompaniment to her talk. She presently dropped
the ‚ÄúMr.,‚Äù to my intense relief, and called me now
Withers, or Wither, now Smithers, and even once
towards the close of the meal distinctly Johnson,
though how on earth my name suggested it, or whose
face mine had reanimated in memory, I cannot
conceive.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd is Arthur a good boy at school, Mr. Wither ?‚Äù
was one of her many questions. ‚ÄúDoes he please his
masters ? Is he first in his class ? What does the
reverend Dr. Gummidge think of him, eh ?‚Äù</p>
<p>I knew she was jeering at him, but her face was
adamant against the least flicker of sarcasm or
facetiousness. I gazed fixedly at a blushing crescent
of lobster.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre eighth, aren‚Äôt you, Seaton ?‚Äù</p>
<p>Seaton moved his small pupils towards his aunt.
But she continued to gaze with a kind of concen-
trated detachment at me.</p>
<p>‚ÄúArthur will never make a brilliant scholar, I
fear,‚Äù she said, lifting a dexterously-burdened fork to
her wide mouth. . . .</p>
<p>After luncheon she preceded me up to my bedroom.
It was a jolly little bedroom, with a brass fender and
rugs and a polished floor, on which it was possible,
I afterwards found, to play ‚Äúsnow-shoes.‚Äù Ov
the washstand was a little black-framed water-cr‚Äô
drawing, depicting a large eye with an ext
fishlike intensity in the spark of light on
pupil; and in ‚Äúilluminated‚Äù lettering b
printed very minutely, ‚ÄúThou God</p>
<p>104 seaton‚Äôs aunt</p>
<p>followed by a long looped monogram, in</p>
<p>the corner. The other pictures were all of the sea ;
brigs on blue water ; a schooner overtopping chalk
cMs ; a rocky island of prodigious steepness, with
two tiny sailors dragging a monstrous boat up a
shelf of beach.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is the room. Withers, my brother William
died in when a boy. Admire the view I‚Äù</p>
<p>I looked out of the window across the tree-tops.
It was a day hot with sunshine over the green fields,
and the cattle were standing swishing their tails in the
shallow water. But the view at the moment was only
exaggeratedly vivid because I was horribly dreading
that she would presently enquire after my luggage,
and I had not brought even a toothbrush. I need
have had no feat. Hers was not that highly-civilised</p>
<p>2 rpe of mind that is stuffed with sharp, material
etails. Nor could her ample presence be described
as in the least motherly.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI would never consent to question a school-
fellow behind my nephew‚Äôs back,‚Äù she said, standing
in the middle of the room, ‚Äúbut tell me, Smithers,
/ is Arthur so unpopular ? You, I understand,
his only close friend.‚Äù She stood in a dazzle of
and out of it her eyes regarded me with such
en penetration beneath their thick lids that I
ubt if my face concealed the least thought from
‚ÄúBut there, there,‚Äù she added very suavely,
‚ñ†‚ñ†g her head a little, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt trouble to answer
‚Ä¢‚Äô^er extort an answer. Boys are queer fish,
ht perhaps have suggested his washing
fore luncheon; but ‚Äî ^not my choice,</p>
<p>Seaton‚Äôs aunt./ 105</p>
<p>Smithers. God forbid ! And now, perhaps, you
would like to go into the garden again. I cannot
actually see from here, but I should not be surprised
if Arthur is now skulking behind that hedge.‚Äù</p>
<p>He was. I saw his head come out and take a
rapid glance at the windows.</p>
<p>‚ÄúJoin him, Mr. Smithers ; we shall meet again,
I hope, at the tea-table. The afternoon I spend in
retirement.‚Äù</p>
<p>Whether or not, Seaton and I had not been long
engaged with the aid of two green switches in riding
round and round a lumbering old gray horse we
found in the meadow, before a rather bunched-up
figure appeared, walking along the field -path on the
other side of the water, with a magenta parasol
studiously lowered in our direction throughout her
slow progress, as if that were the magnetic needle
and we the fixed Pole. Seaton at once lost all nerve
in his tiding. At the next lurch of the old mare‚Äôs
heels he toppled over into the grass, and I slid off the
sleek broad back to join him where he stood, rubbing
his shoulder and sourly watching the rather pompous
figure till it was out of sight.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWas that your aunt, Seaton ?‚Äù I enquired ;
but not tiU then.</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>‚Äú^hy didn‚Äôt she take any notice of us, then ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe never does.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy not ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúOh, she knows all right, without ; that‚Äô
awful part of it.‚Äù Seaton was about the o-
Gumnaidge‚Äôs who ever had the osten</p>
<p>io6 seaton‚Äôs aunt</p>
<p>bad language. He had suffered for it too. But it
wasn‚Äôt, I think, bravado. I believe he really felt
certain things more intensely than most of the other
fellows, and they were generally things that fortunate
and average people do not feel at all ‚Äî the peculiar
quality, for instance, of the British schoolboy‚Äôs
imagination.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI tell you. Withers,‚Äù he went on moodily,
‚Ä¢slinking across the meadow with his hands covered
up in his pockets, ‚Äúshe sees everything. And what
she doesn‚Äôt see she knows without.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut how ?‚Äù I said, not because I was much inter-
ested, but because the afternoon was so hot and
tiresome and purposeless, and it seemed more of a
bore to remain silent. Seaton turned gloomily and
spoke in a very low voice.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt appear to be talking of her, if you wouldn‚Äôt
mind. It‚Äôs ‚Äî because she‚Äôs in league with the devil.‚Äù
He nodded his head and stooped to pick up a round
flat pebble. ‚ÄúI teU you,‚Äù he said, stiU stooping,
‚Äúyou fellows don‚Äôt realise what it is. I know I‚Äôm a
bit close and all that. But so would you be if you
had that old hag listening to every thought you
think.‚Äù</p>
<p>I looked at him, then turned and surveyed one by
one the windows of the house.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢-‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your pater ?‚Äù I said awkwardly. ,
Dead, ages and ages ago, and my mother too.
‚ñ†&rsquo;¬ªot my aunt by rights.‚Äù</p>
<p>&rsquo; is she, then ?‚Äù</p>
<p>She‚Äôs not my mother‚Äôs sister, because my
\ married twice; and she‚Äôs one of the</p>
<p>Seaton‚Äôs aunt &rsquo; 107</p>
<p>first lot. I don‚Äôt know what you call her, but
anyhow she‚Äôs not my real aunt.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe gives you plenty of pocket-money.‚Äù</p>
<p>Seaton looked steadfastly at me out of his flat eyes.
‚ÄúShe can‚Äôt give me what‚Äôs mine. When I come of
age half of the whole lot will be mine ; and what‚Äôs
more‚Äù ‚Äî he turned his back on the house ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make
her hand over every blessed shilling of it.‚Äù</p>
<p>I put my hands in my pockets and stared at Seaton ;
‚ÄúIs it much?‚Äù</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWho told you ?‚Äù He got suddenly very angry ;
a darkish red came into his cheeks, bis eyes glistened,
but he made no answer, and we loitered listlessly
about the garden until it was time for tea. . . .</p>
<p>Seaton‚Äôs aunt was wearing an extraordinary kind
of lace jacket when we sidled sheepishly into the
drawing-room together. She greeted me with a
heavy and protracted smUe, and bade me bring a
chair close to the little table.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI hope Arthur has made you feel at home,‚Äù she
said as she handed me my cup in her crooked hand.
‚ÄúHe don‚Äôt talk mxich to me ; but then I‚Äôm an old
woman. You must come again. Wither, and draw
him out of his shell. You old snail !‚Äù She wagged
her head at Seaton, who sat munching cake a&rsquo;
watching her intendy.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd we must correspond, perhaps.‚Äù She &rsquo;
shut her eyes at me. ‚ÄúYou must write and
everything behind the creature‚Äôs back.‚Äù J
found her rather disquieting companv. T
drew on. Lamps were brought in by ^</p>
<p>io8 \ seaton‚Äôs aunt</p>
<p>nondescript face and very quiet footsteps. Seaton was
told to bring out the chess-men. And we played a
game, she and I, with her big chin thrust over the
board at every move as she gloated over the pieces
and occasionally croaked ‚ÄúCheck !‚Äù ‚Äî after which she
would sit back inscrutably staring at me. But the
game was never finished. She simply hemmed me
defencelessly in with a cloud of men that held me
impotent, and yet one and all refused to administer
to my poor flustered old king a merciful coup de ff^dee.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere,‚Äù she said, as the clock struck ten ‚Äî ‚Äúa
drawn game. Withers. We are very evenly matched.
A very creditable defence. Withers. You know
your room. There‚Äôs supper on a tray in the dining-
room. Don‚Äôt let the creature over-eat himself. The
gong wiU sound three-quarters of an hour before a
punctual breakfast.‚Äù She held out her cheek to
Seaton, and he kissed it with obvious perfunctoriness.
With me she shook hands.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAn excellent game,‚Äù she said cordially, ‚ÄòT)ut my
memory is poor, and‚Äù ‚Äî she swept the pieces helter-
skelter into the box ‚Äî ‚Äúthe result will never be
known.‚Äù She raised her great head far back. ‚ÄúEh?‚Äù</p>
<p>It was a kind of challenge, and I could only
nurmur : ‚ÄúOh, I was absolutely in a hole, you
oti&rsquo;ow!‚Äù when she burst out laughing and waved us
out of the room.</p>
<p>‚Äô^tton and I stood and ate our supper, with one
ick to light us, in a corner of the dining-room,
‚Äôd how would you like it ?‚Äù he said vegr
cautiously poking his head round ¬£he</p>
<p>‚ÄúLike what ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúBeing spied on ‚Äî every blessed thing you do and
think?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt like it at all,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúif she does.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd yet you let her smash you up at chess !‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt let her !‚Äù I said, indignantly.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWell, you funked it, then.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd I didn‚Äôt funk it either,‚Äù I said ; ‚Äúshe‚Äôs so
jolly clever with her knights.‚Äù Seaton stared fixedly
at the candle. ‚ÄúYou wait, that‚Äôs all,‚Äù he said slowly.
And we went upstairs to bed.</p>
<p>I had not been long in bed, I think, when I was
cautiously awakened by a touch on my shoulder.
And there was Seaton‚Äôs face in the candlelight ‚Äî and
his eyes looking into mine.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up ?‚Äù I said, rising quickly to my elbow.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt scurry,‚Äù he whispered, ‚Äúor she‚Äôll hear.
I‚Äôm sorry for waking you, but I didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd be
asleep so soon.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy, what‚Äôs the time, then ?‚Äù Seaton wore,
what was then rather unusual, a night-suit, and he
hauled his big silver watch out of the pocket in his
jacket.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a quarter to twelve. I never get to sleep
before twelve ‚Äî not here.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat do you do, then ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúOh, I read and listen.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúListen ?‚Äù</p>
<p>Seaton stared into his candle-flame as if he were
listening even then. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt guess what it is.
All you read in ghost stories, that‚Äôs all rot. You
can‚Äôt see much. Withers, but you know all the same.‚Äù</p>
<p>no ¬ª Seaton‚Äôs aunt</p>
<p>‚ÄúKnow what ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy, that they‚Äôre there.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there ?‚Äù I asked fretfully, glancing at the
door.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy. in the house. It swarms with ‚Äôem. Just
you stand still and listen outside my bedroom door
in the middle of the night. I have, dozens of times ;
they‚Äôre all over the place.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúLook here, Seaton,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúyou asked me to
come here, and I didn‚Äôt mind chucking up a leave
just to oblige you and because I‚Äôd promised ; but
don‚Äôt get talking a lot of rot, that‚Äôs ah, or you‚Äôll
know the difference when we get back.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fret,‚Äù he said coldly, turning away. ‚ÄúI
shan‚Äôt be at school long. And what‚Äôs more, you‚Äôre
here now, and there isn‚Äôt anybody else to t^k to.
I‚Äôll chance the other.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúLook here, Seaton,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúyou may think
you‚Äôre going to scare me with a lot of stuff about
voices and ^ that. But I‚Äôll just thank you to clear
out ; and you may please yourself about pottering
about all night.‚Äù</p>
<p>He made no answer ; he was standing by the
dressing-table looking across his candle into the
looking-glass ; he turned and stared slowly round
the walls.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEven this room‚Äôs nothing more than a coflhi.
I suppose she told you ‚Äî ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs all exactly the same as
when my brother William died‚Äô ‚Äî trust her for that 1
And good luck to him, say I. Look at that.‚Äù He
raised his candle close to the little water-colour I
have mentioned. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs hundreds of eyes like</p>
<p>Ill</p>
<p>Seaton‚Äôs aunt &lt;</p>
<p>that in this house ; and even if God does see you. He
takes precious good care you don‚Äôt see Him. And
it‚Äôs just the same with them. I tell you what.
Withers, I‚Äôm getting sick of all this. I shan‚Äôt stand
it much longer.‚Äù</p>
<p>The house was silent within and without, and even
in the yellowish radiance of the candle a faint silver
showed through the open window on my blind. I
slipped off the bedclothes, wide awake, and sat
irresolute on the bedside.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre only guying me,‚Äù I said angrily,
‚Äúbut why is the house full of ‚Äî what you say ? Why
do you hear ‚Äî what you do hear ? TeU me that, you
silly fool !‚Äù</p>
<p>Seaton sat down on a chair and rested his candle-
stick on his knee. He blinked at me calmly. ‚ÄúShe
brings them,‚Äù he said, with lifted eyebrows.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWho? Your aunt?‚Äù</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHow ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI told you,‚Äù he answered pettishly. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs in
league. You don‚Äôt know. She as good as killed my
mother ; I know that. But it‚Äôs not only her by a
long chalk. She just sucks you dry. I know. And
that‚Äôs what she‚Äôll do for me ; because I‚Äôm like her ‚Äî
like my mother, I mean. She simply hates to see me
alive. I wouldn‚Äôt be like that old she-wolf for a
million pounds. And so‚Äù ‚Äî he broke off, with a
comprehensive wave of his candlestick ‚Äî ‚Äúthey‚Äôre
always here. Ah, my boy, wait till she‚Äôs dead 1
She‚Äôll hear something then, I can teU you. It‚Äôs all
very well now, but wait till then ! I wouldn‚Äôt be in</p>
<p>112 &gt; seaton‚Äôs aunt</p>
<p>her shoes when she has to clear out ‚Äî ^for something.
Don‚Äôt you go and believe I care for ghosts, or what-
ever you like to call them. We‚Äôre all in the same box.
We‚Äôre all under her thumb.‚Äù</p>
<p>He wi^s looking almost nonchalantly at the ceiling
at the moment, when I saw his face change, saw his
eyes suddenly drop like shot birds and fix themselves
on the cranny of the door he had just left ajar. Even
from where I sat I could see his colour change ;
he went greenish. He crouched without stirring,
simply fixed. And I, scarcely daring to breathe,
sat with creeping skin, simply watching him. His
hands relaxed, and he gave a kind of sigh.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWas that one ?‚Äù I whispered, with a timid show
of jaimtiness. He looked round, opened his mouth,
and nodded. ‚ÄúWhat ?‚Äù I said. He jerked his thumb
with meaningful eyes, and I knew that he meant
that his aunt had been there listening at our door
cranny.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLook here, Seaton,‚Äù I said once more, wriggling
to my feet. ‚ÄúYou may think I‚Äôm a jolly noodle ;
just as you please. But your aunt has been civil to
me and all Aat, and I don‚Äôt believe a word you say
about her, that‚Äôs all, and never did. Every fellow‚Äôs
a bit off Ms pluck at night, and you may think it a
fine sport to try your rubbish on me. I heard your
aunt come upstairs before I fell asleep. And I‚ÄôU
bet you a level tanner she‚Äôs in bed now. What‚Äôs
more, you can keep your blessed ghosts to yourself.
It‚Äôs a guilty conscience, I should think. ‚Äù</p>
<p>Seaton looked at me curiously, without answering
for a moment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a liar. Withers ; but I‚Äôm not</p>
<p>SEATON S AUNT ‚Ä¢ 11}</p>
<p>going to quarrel either. You‚Äôre the only chap I cate
a button for ; or, at any rate, you‚Äôre the only chap
that‚Äôs ever come here ; and it‚Äôs something to tell a
fellow what you feel. I don‚Äôt care a fig for fifty
thousand ghosts, although I swear on my solemn
oath that I know they‚Äôre here. But she‚Äù ‚Äî he
turned dehberately ‚Äî ‚Äúyou laid a tanner she‚Äôs in bed.
Withers; well, I know different. She‚Äôs never in bed
much of the night, and I‚Äôll prove it, too, just to show
you I‚Äôm not such a nolly as you think I am. Come

<p>sounds as these I seemed to begin to be conscious, as
it were, of the lightest of footfalls, sounds as faint as
the vanishing remembrance of voices in a dream.
Seaton was all in obscurity except his face ; out of
that his eyes gleamed darkly, watching me.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôd hear, too, in time, my fine soldier,‚Äù he
muttered. ‚ÄúCome on !‚Äù</p>
<p>He descended the stairs, slipping his lean fingers
lightly along the balusters. He turned to the right
at the loop, and I followed him barefooted along a
thickly-carpeted corridor. At the end stood a door

<p>Seaton‚Äôs AUNT ‚ñ† 115</p>
<p>and could hardly speak for his teeth chattering. And
very distinctly, in the hush that followed his whisper,
I heard approaching a faint unhurried voluminous
rustle. Seaton clutched my arm, dragged me to the
right across the room to a large cupboard, and drew
the door close to on us. And, presently, as with
bursting lungs I peeped out into the long, low,
curtained bedroom, waddled in that wonderful great
head and body. I can see her now, all patched and
lined with shadow, her tied-up hair (she must have
had enormous quantities of it for so old a woman),
her heavy lids above those flat, slow, vigilant eyes.
She just passed across my ken in the vague dusk ; but
the bed was out of sight.</p>
<p>We waited on and on, listening to the clock‚Äôs
muffled ticking. Not the ghost of a sound rose up
from the great bed. Either she lay archly listening
or slept a sleep serener than an infant‚Äôs. And when,
it seemed, we had been hours in hiding and were
cramped, chilled, and half suffocated, we crept out on
all fours, with terror knocking at our ribs, and so
down the five narrow stairs and back to the little
candle-lit blue-and-gold bedroom.</p>
<p>Once there, Seaton gave in. He sat livid on a
chair with closed eyes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHere,‚Äù I said, shaking his arm, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to bed ;
f‚Äôye had enough of this foolery ; I‚Äôm going to bed.‚Äù
His lips quivered, but he made no answer. I poured
out some water into my basin and, with that cold
pictured azure eye fixed on us, bespattered Seaton‚Äôs
sallow face and forehead and dabbled his hair. He
presently sighed and opened fish-like eyes.</p>
<p>ii6 ‚Ä¢ Seaton‚Äôs aunt</p>
<p>‚ÄúCome on !‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get shamming, there‚Äôs
a good chap. Get on my back, if you like, and I‚Äôll
carry you into your bedroom.‚Äù</p>
<p>He waved me away and stood up. So, with my
candle in one hand, I took him under the arm and
walked him along according to his direction down the
corridor. His was a much dingier room than mine,
and littered with boxes, paper, cages, and clothes. I
huddled him into bed and turned to go. And
suddenly, I can hardly explain it now, a kind of cold
and deadly terror swept over me. I alruost ran out
of the room, with eyes fixed rigidly in front of me,
blew out my candle, and buried my head under the
bedclothes.</p>
<p>When I awoke, roused not by a gong, but by a
long-continued tapping at my door, sunlight was
raying in on cornice and bedpost, and birds were
singing in the garden. I got up, ashamed of the
nignr s tolly, dressed quickly, and went downstaits.
The breakfast room was sweet with flowers and fruit
and honey. Seaton‚Äôs aunt was standiug^ in the garden
beside the open French window, feediag a great
flutter of birds. I watched her for a moment, unseen.
Her face was set in a deep reverie beneath the shadow
of a big loose sun-hat. It was deeply lined, crooked,
and, in a way I can‚Äôt describe, focedly vacant and
strange, I coughed, and she turned at oncfe with a
prodigious smile to enquire how I had slept. And in
that mysterious way by which we learn each other‚Äôs
secret thoughts without a sentence spoken I knew
that she had followed every word and movement of
the night before, and was triumphing over my affected</p>
<p>Seaton‚Äôs aunt 117</p>
<p>innocence and ridiculing my friendly and too easy
advances.</p>
<p>We returned to school, Seaton and I, lavishly laden,
and by rail all the way. I made no reference to the
obscure talk we had had, and resolutely refused to
meet his eyes or to take up the hints he let fall. I
was relieved ‚Äî and yet I was sorry ‚Äî to be going back,
and strode on as fast as I could from the station, with
Seaton almost trotting at my heels. But he insisted
on buying more fruit and sweets ‚Äî my share of which
I accepted with a very bad grace. It was uncom-
fortably like a bribe ; and, after all, I had no quarrel
with his rum old aunt, and hadn‚Äôt really believed half
the stuff he had told me.</p>
<p>I saw as little of him as I could after that. He
never referred to our visit or resumed his confidences,
though in class I would sometimes catch his eye fixed
on mine, full of a mute understanding, which I easily
affected not to understand. He left Gummidge‚Äôs, as
I have said, rather abruptly, though I never heard of
anything to his discredit. And I did not see him
or have any news of him again till by chance we met
one summer afternoon in the Strand.</p>
<p>He was dressed rather oddly in a coat too large for
him and a bright silky tie. But we instantly recog-
nised oae another under the awning of a cheap
jeweller‚Äôs shop. He immediately attached himself to
me and dragged me off, not too cheerfully, to lunch
with him at an Italian restaurant neat by. He
chattered about our old school, which he remembered
only with dislike and disgust ; told me cold-bloodedly</p>
<p>Il8 . seaton‚Äôs aunt</p>
<p>of the disastrous fate of one or two of the old fellows
who had been among his chief tormentors ; insisted
on an expensive wine and the whole gamut of the
foreign menu ; and finally informed me, with a good
deal of niggling, that he had come up to town to
buy an engagement-ring.</p>
<p>And of course : ‚ÄúHov/ is your aunt ?‚Äù I enquired
at last.</p>
<p>He seemed to have been awaiting the question. It
fell like a stone into a deep pool, so many expressions
flitted across his long Un-English face.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe‚Äôs aged a good deal,‚Äù he said soft!‚Äù, and broke
off.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe‚Äôs been very decent,‚Äù he continued presently
after, and paused again. ‚ÄúIn a way.‚Äù He eyed me
fleetingly. ‚ÄúI dare say you heard that ‚Äîshe ‚Äî that is,
that wc ‚Äî had lost a good deal of money.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOh, yes !‚Äù said Seaton, and paused again.</p>
<p>And somehow, poor fellow, I knew in the clink
and clatter of glass and voices that he had lied to me ;
that he did not possess, and never had possessed, a
penny beyond what his aunt had squandered on his
too ample allowance of pocket-money.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd the ghosts ?‚Äù I enquired quizzically.</p>
<p>He grew instantly solemn, and, though it may have
been my fancy, slightly yellowed. But ‚ÄúYou are
making game of me, Withers,‚Äù was all he said.</p>
<p>He asked for my address, and I rather reluctantly
gave him my card.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLook here. Withers,‚Äù he said, as we stood together
in the sunlight on the kerb, saying good-bye, ‚Äúhere I</p>
<p>Seaton‚Äôs aunt . 119</p>
<p>am, and‚Äî and it‚Äôs all very well. I‚Äôm not perhaps as
fanciful as I was. But you are practically the only
friend I have on earth ‚Äî except Alice. . . . And
there ‚Äî to make a clean breast of it, I‚Äôm not sure that
my aunt cares much about my getting married. She
doesn‚Äôt say so, of course. You know her well enough
for that.‚Äù He looked sidelong at the rattling gaudy
traffic.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat I was going to say is this ; Would you
mind coming down ? You needn‚Äôt stay the night
imless you please, though, of course, you know you
would be awfully welcome. But I should like you to
meet my ‚Äî to meet Alice ; and then, perhaps, you
might teU me your honest opinion of ‚Äî of the other
too.‚Äù</p>
<p>I vaguely demurred. He pressed me. And we
parted with a half promise that I would come. He
‚Äúwaved his ball-topped cane at me and ran off in his
|ong jacket after a ‚Äôbus.</p>
<p>, A letter arrived soon after, in his small weak
handwriting, giving me full particulars regarding
f-.ute and trains. And without the least curiosity,
feven, perhaps with some little annoyance that chance
should have thrown us together again, I accepted his
invitation and arrived one hazy midday at his out-of-
the-way station to find him sitting on a low seat under
a dump of double hollyhocks, awaiting me.</p>
<p>! His face looked absent and singularly listless ; but
(he seemed, none the less, pleased to see me.</p>
<p>I We walked up the village street, past the little
, din^ apothecary‚Äôs and the empty forge, and, as on
! my mst visit, skirted the house together, and, instead</p>
<p>120 SHAT0N*S AUNT</p>
<p>of entering by the front door, made our way down the
green path into the garden at the back. A pale haze
of cloud muffled the sun ; the garden lay in a grey
shimmer ‚Äî its old trees, its snap-dragoned faintly
glittering walls. But now there was an air of slovenli-
ness where before all had been neat and methodical.
In a patch of shallowly-dug soil stood a worn-down
spade leaning against a tree. There was an old broken
wheelbarrow. The roses had run to leaf and briar;
the fruit-trees were unpruned. The goddess of neglect
brooded in secret.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt much of a gardener, Seaton,‚Äù I said,
with a sigh of ease.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think, do you know, I like it best like this,‚Äù said
Seaton. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt any man now, of course.
Can‚Äôt afford it.‚Äù He stood staring at his little dark
square of freshly-turned earth. ‚ÄúAnd it always seems
to me,‚Äù he went on ruminatingly,‚Äúthat, after all, we are
nothing better than interlopers on the earffl, dis-
figuring and staining wherever we go. I know its
shocking blasphemy to say so, but then it‚Äôs different
here, you see. We are further away.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúTo tell you the truth, Seaton, I don‚Äôt quite see,‚Äù
I said; ‚Äúbut it isn‚Äôt a new philosophy, is it?
Anyhow, it‚Äôs a precious beastly one.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only what I think,‚Äù he replied, with all his odd
old stubborn meekness.</p>
<p>We wandered on together, talking little, and still
with that expression of uneasy vigilance on Seaton‚Äôs
face. He pulled out his watch as we stood gazing
idly over the green meadows and the dark motionless
bulrushes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think, perhaps, it‚Äôs nearly time for lunch,‚Äù he
said. ‚ÄúWould you like to come in ?‚Äù</p>
<p>We turned and walked slowly towards the house,
across whose windows I confess my own eyes, too,
went restlessly wandering in search of its rather dis-
concerting inmate. There was a pathetic look of
draggledness, of want of means and care, rust and
overgrowth and faded paint. Seaton‚Äôs aunt, a little
to my relief, did not share our meal. Seaton carved
the cold me&rsquo;^t, and dispatched a heaped-up plate by an
elderly servant for his aunt‚Äôs private consumption.
We talked Uttle and in half-suppressed tones, and
sipped a bottle of Madeira which Seaton had rather
heedfully fetched out of the great mahogany side-
board.</p>
<p>I played him a dull and effortless game of chess,
yawning between the moves he himself made almost
at haphazard, and with attention elsewhere engaged.
About fiv^e o‚Äôclock came the sound of a distant ring,
and Seaton jumped up, overturning the board, and so
ending a game that else might have fatuously contin-
ued to this day. He effusively excused himself, and
after some little while returned with a slim, dark,
rather sallow girl of about nineteen, in a white gown
and hat, to whom I was presented with some little
nervousness as his ‚Äúdear old friend and schoolfellow.‚Äù</p>
<p>We talked on in the pale afternoon light, still, as it
seemed to me, and even in spite of a red effort to be
cleat and gay, in a half-suppressed, lack-lustre fashion.
We all seemed, if it were not my fancy, to be expectant,
to be rather anxiously awaiting an arrivd, the appear-
ance of someone who all but filled our collective</p>
<p>122 SEATON‚ÄôS AUNT</p>
<p>consciousness. Seaton talked least of all, and in a
restless interjectory way, as he continually fidgeted
from chair to chair. At last he proposed a stroll in
the garden before the sun should have quite gone
down.</p>
<p>Alice walked between us. Her hair and eyes were
conspicuously dark against the whiteness of her gown.
She carried herself not ungracefully, and yet without
the least movement of her arms and body, and
answered us both without turning her head. There
was a curious provocative reserve in that impassive
and rather long face, a half-unconscious strength of
character.</p>
<p>And yet somehow I knew ‚Äî I believe we all knew ‚Äî
that this walk, this discussion of their future plans
was a futility. I had nothing to base such a cynicism
on, except only a vague sense of oppression, the
foreboding remembrance of the inert invincible
power in the background, to whom optimistic plans
and love-making and youth are as chaff and thistle-
down. We came back, silent, in the last light.
Seaton‚Äôs aunt was there ‚Äî under an old brass lamp.
Her hair was as barbarously massed and curled as ever.
Her eyehds, I think, himg even a litde heavier in age
over their slow-moving inscrutable pupils. We filed
in softly out of the evening, and I made my bow.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn this short interval, Mr. Withers,‚Äù she remarked
amiably, ‚Äúyou have put off youth, put on the man.
Dear me, how sad it is to see the young days vanishing !
Sit down. My nephew tells me you met by chance ‚Äî
or act of Providence, shall we call it ? ‚Äî and in my
beloved Strand I You, I understand, are to be best</p>
<p>Seaton‚Äôs aunt . 123</p>
<p>man ‚Äî yes, best man, or am I divulging secrets ?‚Äù
She surveyed Arthur and Alice with overwhelming
graciousness. They sat apart on two low chairs and
smiled in return.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd Arthur ‚Äî how do you think Arthur is
looking ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think he looks very much in need of a change,‚Äù
I said deliberately.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA change ! Indeed ?‚Äù She all but shut her eyes
at me and with an exaggerated sentimentality shook
her head. ‚ÄúMy dear Mr. Withers ! Are we not ail
in need of a change in this fleeting, fleeting world ?‚Äù
She mused over the remark like a connoisseur. ‚ÄúAnd
you,‚Äù she continued, turning abruptly to Alice, ‚ÄúI
hope you pointed out to Mr. Withers all my pretty
bits ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe walked round the garden,‚Äù said Alice,
looking out of the window. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very beautiful
evening.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Äú7j it ?‚Äù said the old lady, starting up violendy.
‚ÄúThen on this very beautiful evening we will go in to
supper. Mr. Withers, vour arm ; Arthur, bring your
bride.‚Äù</p>
<p>I can scarcely describe with what curious rumina-
tions I led the way into the faded, heavy-aired dining-
room, with this indefinable old creature leaning
weightily on my arm ‚Äî the large flat bracelet on the
yellow-laced wrist. She fumed a little, breathed
rather heavily, as if with an eftort of mind rather than
of body ; for she had grown much stouter and yet
litde more proportionate. And to talk into that
great white face, so close to mine, was a queer experi-</p>
<p>124 ‚Ä¢ Seaton‚Äôs aunt</p>
<p>cnce in the dim light of the corridor, and even in the
twinkling crystal of the candles. She was naitve ‚Äî
appallingly nafve ; she was sudden and superficial ;
she was even arch ; and all these in the brief, rather
puffy passage from one room to the other, with these
two tongue-tied children bringing up the rear. The
meal was tremendous. I have never seen such a
monstrous salad. But the dishes were greasy and
over-spiced, and were indifferently cooked. One
thing only was quite unchanged ‚Äî my hostess‚Äôs
appetite was as Gargantuan as ever. The old solid
candelabra that lighted us stood before her high-
backed chair. Seaton sat a little reinoved, with his
plate almost in darkness.</p>
<p>And throughout this prodigious meal his aunt
talked, mainly to me, mainly at Seaton, with an
occasional satirical courtesy to Alice and muttered
explosions of directions to the servant. She had
aged, and yet, if it be not nonsense to say so, seemed
no older. I suppose to the Pyramids a decade is but
as the rustling down of a handful of dust. And she
reminded me of some such unshakable prehistoricism.
She certainly was an amazing talker ‚Äî racy, extrava-
gant, with a delivery that was perfectly overwhelming.
As for Seaton ‚Äî her flashes of silence were for him.
On her enormous volubility would suddenly fall a
hush : acid sarcasm would be left implied ; and she
would sit sofdy moving her great head, with eyes
fixed full in a dreamy smile ; but with her whole
attention, one could see, slowly, joyously absorbing
his mute discomfiture.</p>
<p>She confided in us her views on a theme vaguely</p>
<p>Seaton‚Äôs aunt , 125</p>
<p>occupying at the moment, I suppose, all our minds.
‚ÄúWe have barbarous institutions, and so must put lip,
I suppose, with a never-ending procession of fools ‚Äî
of fools ad infinittmi. Marriage, Mr. Withers, was
instituted in the privacy of a garden ; suh r&rsquo;osa, as it
were. Civilization flaunts it in the glare of day. The
dull marry the poor ; the rich the effete ; and so our
New Jerusalem is peopled with naturals, plain and
coloured, at either end. I detest foUy ; I detest still
more (if I must be frank, dear Arthur) mere cleverness.
Mankind has simply become a tailless host of unin-
stinctive animals. We should never have taken to
Evolution, Mr. Withers. ‚ÄòNatural Selection !‚Äô ‚Äî
little gods and fishes ! ‚Äî the deaf for the dumb. We
should have used our brains ‚Äî intellectual pride, the
ecclesiastics call it. And by brains I mean ‚Äî what do
I mean, Alice ? ‚Äî I mean, my dear child,‚Äù and she laid
two gross fingers on Alice‚Äôs narrow sleeve, ‚ÄúI mean
courage. Consider it, Arthur. I read that the
scientific world is once more beginning to be afraid
of spiritual agencies. Spiritual agencies that tap, and
actually float, bless their hearts ! I think just one
more of those mulberries ‚Äî thank you.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey talk about ‚ÄòbUnd Love,‚Äô ‚Äù she ran inconse-
quently on as she helped herself, with eyes roving on
the dish, ‚Äúbut why blind ? I think, do you know, from
weeping over its rickets. After all, it is we plain
women that triumph, Mr. Withers, beyond the
mockery of time. Alice, now ! Fleeting, fleeting is
youth, my child. What‚Äôs that you were confiding to
your plate, Arthur ? Satirical boy. He laughs at
his old aunt : nay, but thou didst laugh. He detests</p>
<p>126 . Seaton‚Äôs aunt</p>
<p>all sentiment. He whispers the most acid asides.
Come, my love, we will leave these cynics ; we will
go and commiserate with each other on our sex. The
choice of two evils, Mr. Smithers !‚Äù I opened the
door, and she swept out as if borne on a torrent of
unintelligible indignation ; and Arthur and I were
left in the cleat four-flamed light alone.</p>
<p>For a while wc sat in silence. He shook his head
at my cigarette-case, and I lit a cigarette. Presently he
fidgeted in his chair and poked his head forward into
the light. He paused to rise and shut again the shut
door.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHow long will you be ?‚Äù he said, standing by the
table.</p>
<p>I laughed.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs not that !‚Äù he said, in some confusion.
‚ÄúOf course, I like to be with her. But it‚Äôs not tiiat.
The truth is. Withers, I don‚Äôt care about leaving her
too long with my aunt.‚Äù</p>
<p>I hesitated. He looked at me questioningly.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLook here, Seaton,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúyou know well
enough that I don‚Äôt want to interfere in your affairs, or
to offer advice where it is not wanted. But don‚Äôt you
think perhaps you may not treat your aunt quite in
the right way ? As one gets old, you know, a little
give and take. I have an old godmother, or some-
thing. She talks, too. &hellip; A litde allowance ;
it does no harm. But hang it ail, I‚Äôm no talker.‚Äù</p>
<p>He sat down with his hands in his pockets and still
with his eyes fixed almost incredulously on mine.
‚ÄúHow ?‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWell, my dear fellow, if I‚Äôm any judge ‚Äî ^mind, I</p>
<p>seaton‚Äôs aunt . IZ7</p>
<p>don‚Äôt say that I am ‚Äî ^but I can‚Äôt help thinking she
thinks you don‚Äôt care for her ; and perhaps takes your
silence for ‚Äî for bad temper. She has been very
decent to you, hasn‚Äôt she ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòDecent‚Äô? My God !‚Äù said Seaton.</p>
<p>I smoked on in silence ; but he continued to look
at me with that peculiar concentration I remembered
of old.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think, perhaps, Withers,‚Äù he began
presendy, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you quite understand.
Perhaps you are not quite our kind. You always did,
just like the other fellows, guy me at school. You
laughed at me that night you came to stay here ‚Äî
about the voices and all that. But I don‚Äôt mind
being laughed at ‚Äî because I know.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Äú^ow what ? ‚Äù It was the same old system of dull
question and evasive answer.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI mean I know that what we sec and hear is only
the smallest fraction of what is. I know she lives
quite out of this. She talks to you ; but it‚Äôs all
make-believe. It‚Äôs all a ‚Äòparlour game.‚Äô She‚Äôs not
really with you ; only pitting her outside wits against
yours and enjoying the fooling. She‚Äôs living on
inside, on what you‚Äôre rotten without. That‚Äôs what
it is ‚Äî a cannibal feast. She‚Äôs a spider. It doesn‚Äôt much
matter what you call it. It means the same kind of
thing. I tell you. Withers, she hates me ; and you
can scarcely dream what that hatred means. I used
to think I had an inkling of the reason. It‚Äôs oceans
deeper than that. It just lies behind : herself against
myself. Why, after aU, how much do we really
understand of anything ? We don‚Äôt even know our</p>
<p>128 Seaton&rsquo;s AUNT</p>
<p>own histories, and not a tenth, not a tenth of the
reasons. What has life been to me ? ‚Äî nothing but a
trap. And when one is set free, it only begins again.
I thought you might understand ; but you are on
a different level : that‚Äôs all.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat on earth ate you talking about ?‚Äù I said
contemptuously, in spite of myself.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI mean what I say,‚Äù he said gutturally. ‚ÄúAll this
outside‚Äôs only make-believe ‚Äî but there ! what‚Äôs the
good of talking ? So far as this is concerned I‚Äôm
as good as done. You wait.‚Äù</p>
<p>Seaton blew out three of the candles and, leaving
the vacant room in semi-darkness, we groped our
way along the corridor to the drawing-room. There
a full moon stood shining in at the long garden
windows. Alice sat stooping at the door, with her
hands clasped, looking out, alone.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhere is she ?‚Äù Seaton asked in a low tone.</p>
<p>AUce looked up ; their eyes met in a kin d of
instantaneous understanding, and the door immedi-
ately afterwards opened behind us.</p>
<p>^&lsquo;Stich a moon !‚Äù said a voice that, once heard,
remained unforgettably on the ear. ‚ÄúA night for
lovers, Mr. Withers, if ever there was one. Get a
shawl, my dear Arthur, and take Alice for a little
promenade. I dare say we old cronies will manage to
keep awake. Hasten, hasten, Romeo ! My poor,
poor Alice, how laggard a lover !‚Äù</p>
<p>Seaton returned with a shawl. They drifted out
into the moonlight. My companion gazed after
them till they were out of hearing, turned to me
gravely, and suddenly twisted her white face into such</p>
<p>Seaton&rsquo;s aunt . 129</p>
<p>a convulsion of conteniptuous amusement that I
could only stare blankly in reply.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDear innocent children !‚Äù she said, with inimitable
unctuousness. ‚ÄúWell, well, Mr. Withers, we poor
seasoned old creatures must move with the times.
Do you sing ?‚Äù</p>
<p>I scouted the idea.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThen you must listen to my playing. Chess‚Äù ‚Äî
she clasped her forehead with both cramped hands ‚Äî
‚Äúchess is now completely beyond my poor wits.‚Äù</p>
<p>She sat down at the piano and ran her fingers in a
flourish over the keys. ‚ÄúWliat shall it be ? How
shall we capture them, those passionate hearts ?
That first fine careless rapture ? Poetry itself.‚Äù She
gazed softly into the garden a moment, and presently,
with a shake of her body, began to play the opening
bars of Beethoven‚Äôs ‚ÄúMoonlight‚Äù Sonata, The
piano was old and woolly. She played without
music. The lamplight was rather dim. The moon-
beams from the window lay across the keys. Her
head was in shadow. And whether it was simply due
to her personality or to some really occult skill in her
playing I cannot say : I only know that she gravely
and deliberately set herself to satirise the beautiful
music. It brooded on the air, disillusioned, charged
with mockery and bitterness . I stood at the window ;
far down the path I could see the white figure glim-
mering in that pool of colourless light. A few faint
stars shone, and still that amazing woman behind me
dragged out of the unwilling keys her wonderful
grotesquerie of youth and love and beauty. It came
to an end. I knew the player was watcliing me.</p>
<p>130 . seaton‚Äôs aunt</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, please, go on !‚Äù I murmured, without
turning, &ldquo;Please go on playing, Miss Seaton.‚Äù</p>
<p>No answer was returned to my rather fluttering
sarcasm, but I knew in some indefinite way that I was
being acutely scrutinised, when suddenly there
followed a procession of quiet, plaintive chords
which broke at last softly into the hymn, A Few
More Years Shall Roll.</p>
<p>I confess it held me spellbound. There is a wistful,
strained, plangent pathos in the tune ; but beneath
those masterly old hands it cried softly and bitterly
the solitude and desperate estrangement of the world.
Arthur and his lady-love vanished from my thoughts.
No one could put into a rather hackneyed old hymn-
tune such an appeal who had never known the
meaning of the words. Their meaning, anyhow,
isn‚Äôt commonplace.</p>
<p>I turned very cautiously and glanced at the musician.
She was leaning forward a little over the keys, so that
at the approach of my cautious glance she had but to
turn her face into the thin flood of moonlight for
every feature to become distinctly visible. And so,
with the tune abruptly terminated, we steadfasdy
regarded one another, and she broke into a chuckle of
laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite so seasoned as I supposed, Mr. Withers.
I see you are a real lover of music. To me it is too
painful. It eyokes too much thought. . . .‚Äù</p>
<p>I could scarcely see her little glittering eyes under
their penthouse lids,</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,‚Äù she broke off&rdquo; crisply, &ldquo;tell me, as a
man of the world, what do you think of my new niece ?‚Äù</p>
<p>SEATON AUNT ‚Ä¢ 131</p>
<p>I was not a man of the world, nor was I much
flattered in my stiff and dullish way of looking at
things by being called one ; and I could answer her
without the least hesitation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think, Miss Seaton, I‚Äôm much of a judge
of character. She‚Äôs very charming.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúA brunette ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think I prefer dark women.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd why ? Consider, Mr. Withers ; dark hair,
dark eyes, dark cloud, dark night, dark vision, dark
death, dark grave, dark dark !‚Äù</p>
<p>Perhaps the climax would have rather thrilled
Seaton, but I was too thick-skinned. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know
much about all that,‚Äù I answered rather pompously.
‚ÄúBroad daylight‚Äôs difficult enough for most of us.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAh,‚Äù she said, with a sly inward burst of satirical
laughter.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd I suppose,‚Äù I went on, perhaps a little nettled,
‚Äúit isn‚Äôt the actual darkness one admires, it‚Äôs the con-
trast of the skin, and the colour of the eyes, and ‚Äî
and tlieir shining. Just as,‚Äù I went blundering on,
too late to turn back, ‚Äújust as you only see the stars in
the dark. It would be a long day without any evening.
As for death and the grave, I don‚Äôt suppose we shall
much notice that.‚Äù Arthur and his sweetheart were
slowly returning along the dewy path. ‚ÄúI believe in
making the best of things.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúHow very interesting I‚Äù came the smooth answer.
‚ÄúI see you are a philosopher, Mr. Withers. H‚Äôm !
‚ÄòAs for death and the grave, I don‚Äôt suppose we shall
much notice that.‚Äô Very interesting. . . . And</p>
<p>I‚Äôm sure,‚Äù she added in a particularly suave voice, ‚ÄúI</p>
<p>132 . seaton‚Äôs aunx</p>
<p>‚Ä¢</p>
<p>profoundly hope so.‚Äù She rose slowly from her
stool. ‚ÄúYou will take pity on me again, I hope.
You and I would get on famously ‚Äî kindred spirits ‚Äî
elective affinities. And, of course, now that my
nephew‚Äôs going to leave me, now that his affections
are centred on another, I shall be a very lonely old
woman. . . . Shall I not, Arthur ?‚Äù</p>
<p>Seaton blinked stupidly. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt hear what you
said. Aunt.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI was telling our old friend, Anhur, that when you
are gone I shall be a very lonely old woman.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt think so he said in a strange voice.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe means, Mr. Withers, he means, my dear child,‚Äù
she said, sweeping her eyes over Alice, ‚Äúhe means
that I shall have memory for company ‚Äî heavenly
memory ‚Äî ^the ghosts of other days. Sentimental
boy I And did you enjoy our music, Alice ? Did I
really stir that youthful heart ?. . . .O, O, O,‚Äù</p>
<p>continued the horrible old creature, ‚Äúyou billers and
cooers, I have been listening to such flatteries, such
confessions ! Beware, beware, Arthur, there‚Äôs many
a slip.‚Äù She rolled her little eyes at me, she shrugged
her shoulders at Alice, and gazed an instant stonily
into her nephew‚Äôs face.</p>
<p>I held out my hand. ‚ÄúGood night, good night !‚Äù
she cried. ‚ÄúHe that fights and runs away. Ah,
good night, Mr. Withers ; come again soon !‚Äù She
thrust out her cheek at Alice, and we all three filed
slowly out of the room.</p>
<p>Black shadow darkened the porch and half the
spreading sycamore. We walked without speaking
up the dusty village street. Here and there a crimson</p>
<p>Seaton‚Äôs aunt 133</p>
<p>Hi</p>
<p>window glowed. At the fork of the high-road I said
good-bye. But I had taken hardly more than a
dozen paces when a sudden impulse seized me.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSeaton !‚Äù I called.</p>
<p>He turned in the moonlight.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou have my address ; if by any chance, you
know, you should care to spend a week or two in
town between this and the ‚Äî the Day, we should be
delighted to see you.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThank you. Withers, thank you,‚Äù he said in a low
voice.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI dare say‚Äù ‚Äî I waved my stick gallantly to Alice ‚Äî
‚ÄúI dare say you will be doing some shopping ; we
could all meet,‚Äù I added, laughing.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThank you, thank you. Withers ‚Äî immensely,‚Äù
he repeated.</p>
<p>And so we parted.</p>
<p>But they w&rsquo;ere out of the jog-trot of my prosaic life.
And being of a stolid and incurious nature, I left Seaton
and his marriage, and even his aunt, to themselves
in my memory, and scarcely gave a thought to them
until one day I was walking up the Strand again, and
passed the flashing gloaming of the covered-in
jeweller‚Äôs shop where I had accidentally encountered
my old schoolfellow in the summer. It was one of
those still close autumnal days after a rainy night. I
cannot say why, but a vivid recollection returned to
my mind of our meeting and of how suppressed
Seaton had seemed, and of how vainly he had endeav-
oured to appear assured and eager. He must be
married by now, and bad doubtless returned from his</p>
<p>134 Seaton‚Äôs AUNT</p>
<p>honeymoon. And I had clean forgotten my manners,
had sent not a word of congratulation, nor ‚Äî as I
might very well have done, and as I knew he would
have been immensely pleased at my doing ‚Äî the ghost
of a wedding-present.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I pleaded with myself, I had had
no invitation. I paused at the corner of Trafalgar
Square, and at the bidding of one of those caprices
that seize occasionally on even an unimaginative
mind, I suddenly ran after a green ‚Äôbus that was
passing, and found myself bound on a visit I had not
in the least foreseen.</p>
<p>The colours of autumn were over me village
when I arrived. A beautiful late afternoon sunlight
bathed thatch and meadow. But it was close and hot.
A child, two dogs, a very old woman with a heavy
basket I encountered. One or two incurious trades-
men looked idly up as I passed by. It was all so rural
and so still, my whimiscal impulse had so much
flagged, that for a while I hesitated to venture under
the shadow of the sycamore-tree to enquire after the
happy pair. I deliberately passed by the faint-blue
gates and continued my walk under the high green and
tufted wall. Hollyhocks had attained their topmost
bud and seeded in the little cottage gardens beyond ;
the Michaelmas daisies were in flower ; a sweet
warm aromatic smell of fading leaves was in the air.
Beyond the cottages lay a field where cattle were
grazing, and beyond that I came to a little churchyard.
Then the road wound on, pathless and houseless,
among gorse and bracken. I turned impatiently and
walked quickly back to the house and rang the bell.</p>
<p>Seaton‚Äôs aunt 135</p>
<p>The rather colourless elderly woman who answered
my enquiry informed me that Miss Seaton was at
home, as if only taciturnity forbade her adding, ‚ÄúBut
she doesn‚Äôt want to see you‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMight I, do you think, have Mr. Arthur‚Äôs
address?‚Äù I said.</p>
<p>She looked at me with quiet astonishment, as if
waiting for an explanation. Not the faintest of
smiles came into her thin face.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI will tell Miss Seaton,‚Äù she said after a pause.
‚ÄúPlease walk in.‚Äù</p>
<p>She showed me into the dingy undusted drawing-
room, filled with evening sunshine and with the green-
dyed light that penetrated the leaves overhanging the
long French windows. I sat down and waited on
and on, occasionally aware of a creaking footfall
overhead. At last the door opened a little, and the
great face I had once known peered round at me. For
it was enormously changed ; mainly, I think, because
the old eyes had rather suddenly failed, and so a kind
of stillness and darkness lay over its calm and wrinkled
pallor.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWho is it ?‚Äù she asked.</p>
<p>I explained myself and told her the occasion of my
visit.</p>
<p>She came in and shut the door carefully after her
and, though the fumbling was scarcely perceptible,
groped her way to a chair. She had on an old
dressing-gown, like a cassock, of a patterned cinna-
mon colour.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat is it you want?‚Äù she said, seating herself
and lifting her blank face to mine.</p>
<p>136 ‚Ä¢. Seaton‚Äôs aunt</p>
<p>‚ÄúMight I just have Arthur‚Äôs address?‚Äù I said
deferentially. ‚ÄúI am so sorry to have disturbed you.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúH‚Äôm. You have come to see my nephew ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúNot necessarily to see him, only to hear how he is,
and, of course, Mrs. Seaton, too. I am afraid my
silence must have appeared . . . .‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt noticed your silence,‚Äù croaked the old
voice out of the great mask ; ‚Äúbesides, there isn‚Äôt
any Mrs. Seaton.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAh, then,‚Äù I answered, after a momentary pause,
‚ÄúI have not seemed so black as I painted myself!
And how is Miss Outram ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe‚Äôs gone into Yorkshire,‚Äù answered Seaton‚Äôs
aunt.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd Arthur too ?‚Äù</p>
<p>She did not reply, but simply sat blinking at me
with lifted chin, as if listening, but certainly not for
what I might have to say. I began to feel rather at a
loss.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou were no close friend of my nephew‚Äôs, Mr.
Smithers ?‚Äù she said presently.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I answered, welcoming the cue, ‚Äúand yet,
do you know. Miss Seaton, he is one of the very few
of my old schoolfellows I have come across in the last
few years, and I suppose as one gets older one begins
to value old associations . . . .‚Äù My voice</p>
<p>seemed to trail oflF into a vacuum. ‚ÄúI thought Miss
Outram,‚Äù I hastily began again, ‚Äúa particularly
charming girl. I hope they are both quite well.‚Äù</p>
<p>StiU the old face solemnly blinked at me in silence.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou must find it very lonely. Miss Seaton, with
Arthur away?‚Äù</p>
<p>Seaton‚Äôs aunt 137</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was never lonely in my life,‚Äù she said sourly.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt look to flesh and blood for my company.
When you‚Äôve got to be my age, Mr. Smithers (which
God forbid), you‚Äôll find Life a very different aflair
from what you seem to think it is now. You won‚Äôt
seek company then. I‚Äôll be bound. It‚Äôs thrust on
you.‚Äù Her face edged round into the clear green
light, and her eyes groped, as it were, over my vacant,
disconcerted face. ‚ÄúI dare say, now,‚Äù she said,
composing her mouth, ‚ÄúI dare say my nephew told
you a good many tarradiddles in his time. Oh, yes, a
good many, eh ? He was always a liar. What, now,
did he say of me ? Tell me, now.‚Äù She leant
forward as far as she could, trembling, with an
ingratiating smile.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think he is rather superstitious,‚Äù I said coldly,
‚Äúbut, honestly, I have a very poor memory. Miss
Seaton.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy ?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúZ haven‚Äôt.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe engagement hasn‚Äôt been broken off, I hope.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWell, between you and me,‚Äù she said, shrinking
up and with an immensely confidential grimace, ‚Äúit
has.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm very sorry to hear it. And where is
Arthur?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúEh?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhere is Arthur ?‚Äù</p>
<p>We faced each other mutely among the dead old
bygone furniture. Past all my scrutiny was that
large, flat, grey, cryptic countenance. And then,
suddenly, our eyes for the first time really met. In
some indescribable way out of that thick-lidded</p>
<p>K</p>
<p>158 SEATON‚ÄôS AUNT</p>
<p>obscurity a far small something stooped and looked
out at me for a mere instant of time that seemed
of almost intolerable protrattion. Involuntarily I
blinked and shook my head. She muttered some-
thing with great rapidity, but quite inarticulately ;
rose and hobbled to the door. I thought I heard,
mingled in broken mutterings, something about tea.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPlease, please, don‚Äôt trouble,‚Äù I began, but could -
say no more, for the door was already shut between us.</p>
<p>I stood and looked out on the long-neglected garden.</p>
<p>I could just see the bright greenness of Seaton‚Äôs old
tadpole pond. I wandered about the room. Dusk
began to gather, the last birds in that dense shadowi-
ness of trees had ceased to sing. And not a soimd
was to be heard in the house. I waited on and on,
vainly speculating. I even attempted to ring the
bell; but the wire was broken, and only jangled
loosely at my efforts.</p>
<p>I hesitated, unwilling to call or to venture out, and
yet more unwilling to linger on, waiting for a tea
that promised to be an exceedingly comfortless supper.
And as darkness drew down, a feeling of the utmost
unease and disquietude came over me. AH my talks
with Seaton returned on me with a suddenly enriched
meaning. I recalled again his face as we had stood
hanging over the staircase, listening in the small hours
to the inexph‚Äôcable stirrings of the night. There
were no candles in the room ; every minute the
autumnal darkness deepened. I cautiously opened
the door and listened, and with some little dismay
withdrew, for I was uncertain of my way out. I even
tried the garden, but was confronted under a veritable</p>
<p>Seaton‚Äôs aunt 139</p>
<p>thicket of foliage by a padlocked gate. It would be
a little too ignominious to be caught scaling a friend‚Äôs
garden fence !</p>
<p>Cautiously returning into the still and musty
drawing-room, I took out my watch, and gave the
incredible old woman ten minutes in v/hich to reappear.
And when that tedious ten minutes had ticked by I
could scarcely distinguish its hands. I determined
to wait no longer, drew open the door, and, trusting
to my sense of direction, groped my way through the
corridor that I vaguely remembered led to the front
of the house.</p>
<p>I mounted three or four stairs and, lifting a heavy
curtain, found myself facing the starry fanlight of the
porch. From here I glanced into the gloom of the
dining-room. My fingers were on the latch of the
outer door when I heard a faint stirring in the dark-
ness above the hall. I looked up and became
conscious of, rather than saw, the huddled old figure
looking down on me.</p>
<p>There was an immense hushed pause. Then,
‚ÄúArthur, Arthur,‚Äù whispered an inexpressibly peevish
aspring voice, ‚Äúis that you ? Is that you, Arthur ?‚Äù</p>
<p>I can scarcely say why, but the question horribly
starded me. No conceivable answer occurred to me.
With head craned back, hand clenched on my um-
brella, I continued to stare up into the gloom, in
this fatuous confrontation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOh, oh the voice croaked. ‚ÄúIt is you, is it ?
That disgusting man 1 . . . Go away out. Go</p>
<p>away out.‚Äù</p>
<p>Hesitating no longer. I caught open the door and.</p>
<p>140 . seaton‚Äôs aunt</p>
<p>slamming it behind me, ran out into the garden,
under the gigantic old sycamore, and so out at the
open gate.</p>
<p>I found myself half up the village street before I
stopped nmning. The local butcher was sitting
in his shop reading a piece of newspaper by the light
of a small oil-lamp. I crossed the road and enquired
the way to the station. And after he had with minute
and needless care directed me, I asked casually if
Mr. Arthur Seaton stiU lived with his aunt at the big
house just beyond the village. He poked his head in
at the little parlour door.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a gentleman enquiring after young Mr,
Seaton, Millie,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs dead, ain&rsquo;t he ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy, yes, bless you,‚Äù replied a cheerful voice
from within. ‚ÄúDead and buried these three months
or more ‚Äî ^young Mr. Seaton. And just before he
was to be married, don‚Äôt you remember. Bob ?‚Äù</p>
<p>I saw a fair young woman‚Äôs face peer over the
muslin of the li^e door at me.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I replied, ‚Äúthen I go straight on ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Äò‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it, sir; past the pond, bear up the hill a
bit to the left, and then there‚Äôs the station lights
before your eyes.‚Äù</p>
<p>We looked intelligendy into each other‚Äôs faces in
the beam of the smoky lamp. But not one of the
many questions in my mind could I put into words.</p>
<p>And again I paused irresolutely a few paces further
on. It was not, I fancy, merely a foolish apprehension
of what the raw-boned butcher might ‚Äúthink‚Äù that
prevented my going back to see if I could find
Seaton‚Äôs grave in the benighted churchyard. There</p>
<p>Seaton‚Äôs aunt 141</p>
<p>‚Ä¢was precious litde use in pottering about in the muddy
dark merely to discover where he was buried. And yet
I felt a little uneasy. My rather horrible thought was
that, so fat as I was concerned ‚Äî one of his extremely
few friends ‚Äî he had never been much better than
‚Äúburied‚Äù in my mind.</p>
<p>THE BIRD OF TR‚ÄôAVEL</p>
<p>W E had been talking of houses ‚Äî ^their looks
and ways and influences. What shallow de-
fences they were, we agreed, even for the
materialist, with their brittle glass, and baked clay
bricks; and what mere fungi most of them. Worse still
‚Äî the dreadful species that isn‚Äôt haunted at all, not even
by the graces or ^sgraces of its inmates‚Äî mere barracks
deaf to life and insensitive even to the weathers of
heaven. A cherry-eyed little man of the name of Bate-
son, I remember, told us of a house he had known
that had year by year gently and furtively shifted it-
self a few feet down its valley towards the sea. A
full green mile to go. He said it was the property of
a family so fair of skin and hair as to be almost
albinos ‚Äî but still, a happy one.</p>
<p>Somebody capped this with the ancient yarn of
Lord Montberris, who built a new wing to his family
edifice every year, till the estate was utterly ruined.
Whereupon he set fire to the place in the vain hope of
getting rid of its Devil that way. And at last a quaint
old creature whose name I have forgotten, but who,
so I was told, had been something of a versifier in his
younger days, told us the following rather pointless
story, about a house called the Wood.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI must have been scarcely in my first breeches,‚Äù
he began, rubbing his hand down his face, as if he
was sleepy, ‚Äúwhen I first heard of the old house called
the Wood. We lived then ‚Äî my own people I mean ‚Äî
some few miles distant from it as the crow flies. There
was a remote kinship with its inmates ‚Äî ^people o¬£ a</p>
<p>THE BIRD OF TRAVEL I43</p>
<p>restless blood and with a fair acreage of wild oats to
their credit. A quarrel, a mild feud of the Montague
and Capulet order, had separated us ; and ‚Äî well, we
rarely mentioned them ; their name was seldom heard.
But an old relative of my mother‚Äôs who lived with us in
those days used to teU us about the house, warning us,
in that peculiarly enticing fashion old people have,
not to tempt Providence in that direction. Let but
its evil genius squawk once in our young ears ‚Äî we:
might never come back. That kind of thing.</p>
<p>The consequence was, that while we were still
mere infants, my younger sister and I‚Äî she in a dark
green tartan frock, I remember ‚Äî set out one early
morning, fully intending to see or hear the strange
Bird that was reported to haunt its chaces and its
glades. What if it did instil into us the wander-lust ?
It was just what we wanted ‚Äî Seven League Boots.
We hoped ‚Äî with beating hearts ‚Äî even to sprinkle a
grain or two of salt on its tail !</p>
<p>But we never pushed as far as the house itself, nor
even into the denser woods amongst which it lay. We
sat in the sun-glazed buttercups and ate our dinner,
and, I think, forgot our errand beneath the blossom-
ing may-trees.</p>
<p>‚ÄòT.ater, I tried the same experiment alone. It was
winter then. Deep snow lay on the ground, and I
pushed on through the woods until I was actually in
sight of the upper window&rsquo;s of the house. Dusk was
beginning to thicken ‚Äî its strange thievish blur creep-
ing across the whiteness of the snow. Presently, I
found myself in a sort of walk or alley between a high
hedge of yew and beech. And as I stood there, hes-</p>
<p>144 THE BIRD OF TRAVEL</p>
<p>itating whether to go on or to turn back, a figure ‚Äî a
child of about my own age ‚Äî appeared at its further
end. She was dressed, I remember, in a cloak with a
hood ‚Äî crimson, I think, and carried a muif.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAt that very instant, as our young eyes met across
the wintry air, the last of the evening‚Äôs robins broke
into its tiny, shrill, almost deafening peal of notes.</p>
<p>^And fled. What is it in such moments that catches
the heart back, and stamps them on the memory as if
they were tidings of another world ? Neither of us
stirred. A little snow fell from the vacant twig.</p>
<p>The scarcely visible, narrow, and, to my young
eyes, strangely beautiful face gazed on at me. I might
even then have realised that we were fated some day
to meet again. But even if I had, I should hardly have
surmised it would prove as eventlessly.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThen I was shy ‚Äî a gawkish boy. Moreover, I was
on forbidden ground. I naturally fancied, too, any
such distant cousin might resent my being there ‚Äî a
stranger and uninvited. With a curious drag of my
body in the dead silence that had followed the song,
I began a tuneless sort of airy whistling, turned on
my heel and crunched off in the snow. When in the
white darkening alley I cast back this phantom crea-
ture a thief-like glance out of the corner of my eye,
she had vanished.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt suggest that this incident left much im-
pression on me ‚Äî though I remember every detail of
it to this day. Then Life called me away ; and it was at
least a score or so of years afterwards, while wander-
ing one afternoon in the neighbourhood of my old
home again, that I chanced on a finger-post pointing</p>
<p>THR BIRD OF TRAVEL I45</p>
<p>and stooping towards a thicket of trees beyond a
grassy lane, and marked ‚ÄúTo the Wood.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI had seen something of the world by then, and
without excessive satisfaction. The old story came
back to mind. It linked up two selves rather crudely
severed. I dropped a friendly nod at the post and
turned off in its direction. The path ‚Äî a pretty soggy
one after the heavy summer rains ‚Äî led through neg-
lected preserves, and after walking for half an hour
or so, I came out into a kind of clearing. And there
amid the serene quietude of its remarkably dense
woods was the long, low house.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIts walls, once grey, were now densely mantled
with greenery ‚Äî rose, jasmine, wistaria. It showed,
however, little trace of age or change. An unusual
silence hung over its scene. No smoke, or sign of
occupancy ; indeed, all but one of the windows
within view were shuttered. I doubt if the Ancient
Mariner‚Äôs spectral barque more eloquently expressed
desertion and vacancy.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor a few minutes 1 leaned over a decrepit gate,
my eyes roving to and fro across the wide stone facade.
The whole place looked as if it had settled its eyelids
and composed its mouth for a protracted and stag-
nant sleep. I have heard of toads being found immured
but yet alive in the virgin rock of a coal mine : it
looked like that. At last I made my way up the weedy
path, and, at the back of the house, where even yet a
few hardy human vegetables contested the soil with
Nature‚Äôs wildings, I discovered a door on the latch.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI tapped and listened ; tapped and listened again ;
and, as if it were Echo herself, some hidden thrush‚Äôs</p>
<p>146 THE BIRD OF TRAVEL</p>
<p>rapping of a snail‚Äôs shell against its sacrificial stone
was my only answer. Then, at a venture, I pushed
open the door, stepped in, and making my way along
a narrow passage, entered a little morning room whose
a‚Äôr was burdened with a faint odour as of sweetish
mildew ‚Äî ^long-faded flowers perhaps, A piano stood
where the window might best illuminate the singer,
and a few pictures in water-colour hung on the low
walls. A volume of music lay open on the table : It
was Gounod‚Äôs ‚ÄúHow beautiful upon the mountains.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI passed from room to room, and from an attic
window surveyed many acres ‚Äîvr&rsquo;^sts, one might say
‚Äî of the tree-tops ‚Äî of the motionless woods. And
there my mind lapsed into a sort of daydream. So
closely familiar seemed all around me that I even be-
gan to doubt my own memory. The chests and cup-
boards, the posied carpets on the uneven floors, the
faint nosegays of the wall-paper ‚Äî surely one couldn‚Äôt
so instantly ‚Äúrecognise,‚Äù so to speak, objects seen for
the first time. And yet ‚Äî well, most rare human ex-
perience is like that.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOne talks of years of childhood; centuries
would be a better word. The sense of this familiarity,
this recognition‚Äî was only the sharper, the more wist-
ful (to use an old-fashioned word) for the fact that the
house was vacant, except for the faces upon its walls.
Through narrow crannies sunshine had sucked the
brightness of their colours from tapestry and curtain.
The she-spider had woven and withered in her snares;
and a legionary dust, like fine gold, floated and whirl-
ed in a beam of the declining sun, when I drew the
shutter.</p>
<p>THE BIRD OF TRAVEL 147</p>
<p>‚ÄúI spent the next hout or so that remained of day-
light in roaming the woods, half-elated, half-ashamed
at my trespass, descending into every hollow, ascend-
ing every steep, but, nowhere surprised any secret,
and nowhere confronted hint of ghost of man or
beast. Indeed, so shut in was the house by its trees
that from no point of vantage, so far as I could dis-
cover, could one command any glimpse of the country
beyond the valley. It had been built in a bowl of
verdure and foliage. And for those who had occupied
it, rumour of the world must have been carried by the
winds across the hiUs, unheeded in this hollow.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd then, while I was slowly returning towards it
once more, under the stiU, reddish, evening sky, sud-
denly I heard thrice repeated an extraordinary call.
It pierced my mind like an arrow. It almost absurdly
startled me ‚Äî ^like the shrilling of a decoy, as if my
own name had been called in a strange or forgotten
tongue.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOf English birds, the blackcap, perhaps, sings
with a vestige of that wild and piercing sweetness.
Imagine such a voice twenty times more vigorous
suddenly breaking in upon that evening silence ‚Äî
falling on from note to note as if some unearthly
traveller were summoning from afar his strayed dog
on the hillside !</p>
<p>‚ÄúYet it was evidently a bird that had screamed, for
presently after, as I stood hotly, attentively listening,
I saw mount nobly into the deep blue air and wheel
into the darker thicket a bird of the form and wing of a
kestrel, but much larger ‚Äî its plumage of an almost
snowy whiteness, and of a flight inexpressively serene.</p>
<p>148 THE BIRD OF TRAVEL</p>
<p>‚ÄúI heard no more his cry, though I listened long ;
nor did I set eyes on the bird again, either then, or
afterwards : though the woods were motionless and
so silent the gloaming it seemed as if the world had
swooned.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI was ridiculously elated with my adventure. Had
I not now encountered the veritable Bird of Travel,
which childish legend had credited with such fabul-
ous powers ? Here was the deserted house, and still
echoing in my heart that cry, the lure, as of some in-
nocent Banshee. Who, I wondered, had last heard the
call in the green spring, and feh leap and kindle in-
satiable desire. The past slid back. I was a child again;
looking up into the withered old face of my child-
hood ; ‚Äî</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut is it true, grandmamma ? Please tell us, is it ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòTrue, my dears ? Why I myself perfectly well re-
member Hamilton and Paul when they were boys
not so very many years older than yourselves. I re-
member, too, my father telling me how, one autumn
evening, while he and these two friends of his were
returning with their guns and spaniels through the
woods, the bird had flown out screaming above their
heads. He stopped up his ears. He had his work to do.
But the other two lads watched it in the air, drinking
in its forbidden song. Nothing anyone could say
could restrain them then. Poor fellows ! ‚Äî fine hand-
some fellows. And now, Hamilton lies far away, un-
buried amid the Andes, and Paul drowned in the
Straits of Magellan.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt matter how far the old lady wandered
from her theme of this family‚Äôs destiny, and of their</p>
<p>THE BIRD OF TRAVEL I49</p>
<p>house, and of this ominous bird, she invariably con-
cluded her narrative with this faint, high, trembling
refrain ‚Äî ‚ÄòAnd now, Hamilton lies far away, unburied
amid the Andes, and Paul drowned in the Straits of
Magellan.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Äú 0 Keith of Kavelston, the sorrows of thy line! ‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo ran the ancient story. And had I not that very
afternoon returned the painted gaze of these young
gentlemen? It seems to me, too, though you may
build pretty strongly in this world, even the most
substantial of us must depart in time. All the long
annals of this family, anyhow, were a record of unrest,
of fruitless (or worse) venture, of that absurd nomad
instinct ‚Äî travellers to whom had come eventually,
far from home, the same practised, inevitable guide.
Well, there are some of us who prefer the kind of
travel that can be enjoyed in an armchair !</p>
<p>‚ÄúI had cast one last full look behind me and was
returning by the path I have mentioned, cumbered
with weeds and brambles, when I looked up from out
of my thoughts, and saw approaching me a lady. A
bright chill half-moon had now risen in the twilight
above the woods, and I could see her face distinctly
in its thin radiance. The brows were high and narrow
(for she was carrying her hat in her hand), the nose
was long, like the noses in some old Italian pictures ;
the chin firm, yet rounded to a point.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI could see her plainly in the silverish dusk-light :
and yet, oddly enough, for a moment no flash of
recognition told me who she was. And then I knew.
She eyed me sharply and fully, almost arrogantly, a
dark flush in her cheeks, and bowed. I apologised as</p>
<p>150 THE BIRD OF TRAVEL</p>
<p>best as I could for my inttusion. I reminded her of
the former neighbourhood and acquaintance of our
families ; and told her of my childish curiosity to ex-
plore the woods, yes, and confessed to having heard
the wondrous Phoenix, and confronted its victims.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe listened with face slightly averted, and now
turned with a lively smile. ‚ÄòYou have guessed right,‚Äô
she said,‚Äòthe portraits are of my great-uncles ; and I
am the child you ‚Äî but evidently you don‚Äôt remember
that &hellip;. So please say no more. How I love those
pictures ‚Äî those two outlandish brilliant faces. ‚Ä¢ A
bad painter may be a queerly belling artist.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe glanced into my eyes with a peculiar smile
on her lips. ‚ÄòYou see, nowadays, so far as my own
family is concerned, I am the last,‚Äô she continued.
‚ÄòSo you will realise how welcome even the remotest of
cousins must be ! Of all these years ‚Äî all those births
and deaths, and births again ‚Äî there is not one left
of us in this world here except me.‚Äô She glanced up
under the half-moon with shining eyes, almost as
in apology, yet stiU, as if in boast.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòAnd are you a traveller, too ? ‚Äô‚Äù I questioned.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe beckoned me to follow her back by the way
I had come.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA traveller? No indeed. Not I. Our bright par-
ticular genius has always refused to meddle the least
bit with me. I used to lie awake half the night long,
summer and winter too, in hope to be exiled. That
was years and years ago ; the mad ‚Äôteens. But deep,
deep down, perhaps, I feared my own desire. I cannot
tell you ‚Äî tms place is rooted in my heart. It is me.
Here, only, I seem to catch at the meaning of being</p>
<p>THE BIRD OF TRAVEL I5I</p>
<p>alive at all. It is a little lodge, and yonder winds the
mysterious avenue. I‚Äôll wait. Forgive such nonsense ;
but it is that incessant expectation ‚Äî incessant ; boxes
packed and corded, as it were, the door ajar. It is that</p>
<p>I hunger for ‚Äî for then And this quiet ‚Äî it is</p>
<p>always silent in these woods. The winds and storms
go over us, you see, like the waters in the book of
Job. I never remember it when I am away ‚Äî this cur-
ious quiet even beneath the hoUow tumult of a gale
far overhead ‚Äî ^without an almost unendurable shud-
der- of longing. Shall I ever cease if I begin to talk of
it ? But now I see that with that longing, that greed
‚Äî ^far, far beyond the greed of the little girl I used to
be even for ices and macaroons (and would you be-
lieve it, to see a ghost !) ‚Äî ^it was like keeping a wild
beast without meat, to deny my poor heart its native
air. Better dead than dying. It was an extraordinary
home-coming ‚Äî this very morning. I was alone. I got
back early, soon after daybreak, and opened a window
to the first rose of dawn. I cannot tell you the voracity
of it all : the dew, the depth, and the immortal usual-
ness.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòAnd now ‚Äî well, really it is very delightful ‚Äî
though an hour ago I should have madly resented
such an idea ‚Äî it is delightful to have found so old an
unknown friend waiting me ‚Äî and one remembered
so well.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe laughed out, when I tried to excuse myself for
so dull a memory.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs because you are a poet, Mr. ‚Äô she</p>
<p>said. ‚ÄòYou see, I know all about you ; and you, no-
thing about me 1 1 have noticed it again and again.</p>
<p>152 THE BIRD OF TRAVEL</p>
<p>People with imagination are almost indecently bereft
of the common feelings. And now, will you please sit
on this bench while I make some tea for us both. It‚Äôs
all I can offer. I shan‚Äôt be long. But stuff your fingers
into your ears. He screams at night too ! Now which
was the door I left unfastened ?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúI sat there ‚Äî where she had left me. The moon
slid on, casting her shadows. A few late moths ghost-
ed about me in and out of her beams. It might have
been a dream. I might have been thousands of years
old. Strange, that. Strange. Why, I might have been
in another world . . . But never mind that.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWell, my unconventional hostess returned in a
few minutes, and we sat sipping our tea on the little
balcony in the mild autumnal night.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd as we sat we talked ‚Äî as fancy led ; she in a
rather high-pitched voice, and with curious half-
gestures. It seemed as if she thought always with
arrow on the string and bow bent ‚Äî a bow which a
dull world had invariably reminded her to slacken.
Her eyes were extraordinarily dark and lustrous in
the shadow of that thin clear light, revealing, it
seemed, a curious exaltation of spirit at this sudden
and strange return to solitude and to her old home.
She exulted in her solitude, and had not the least mis-
giving at the thought of staying indefinitely in the
house.</p>
<p>‚Äú Tt won‚Äôt be for long,‚Äô she repeated. ‚ÄòThey have
patched and tortured and experimented, and at last
I am done. They‚Äôve as good as told me so now, the
poor dear, scientific creatures. Surely it is not sur-
render when the wound is mortal and the enemy is‚Äî -</p>
<p>THE BIRD OF TRAVEL I55</p>
<p>that one. But enemy ! What shallow, stuffy nonsense
that is ! We have handed down our restless memories,
the old forlorn absurdities, father to son and son again,
and now I am, well, just the last echo of the refrain be-
fore the end. ‚ÄòAh, Elizabeth,‚Äô mother used to laugh at
me in the old days when we were a happy family in the
Wood, ‚Äòhe will sing to you too in due season.‚Äô Pro-
bably she meant a far tamer fowl. In her heart of
hearts she hated the wander-taint, as you may
imagine. And yet ‚Äî she herself at last couldn‚Äôt resist
it. We are wayfaring men one and all and my journey
will be better than dreams.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere was a peculiar sidelong movement of her
head, as she said this ; she was stooping a little,
busied over the tea-things. With teapot poised in one
thin narrow hand, she suddenly turned on me.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòShall I tell you why? Shall I?‚Äô Again that cur-
ious movement, and I fancied for an instant that she
was about to cry. ‚ÄòIt is because I am coming back.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor an instant or two I did not catch her mean-
ing ; then, with that odd warmth and confusion with-
in one‚Äôs very body which any unforeseen reference to
death inevitably brings, I muttered a few of the
familiar cliches. ‚ÄòBesides,‚Äô I added, ‚Äòlook at me.
Surely this face is nearer the sight of death than
yours. You cannot see your own in this moonlight.
Shall we have a wager on it ? And pay ‚Äî when at last
we meet again? For good? Come, now.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòYes, but you see,‚Äô she replied eagerly, ‚Äòit‚Äôs all
yety well to talk about happy reunions. W&rsquo;here ?
Cali it a condition of mind ; whose ? Surely that which
found the very bones of its delight here ? Do you re-</p>
<p>154 the bird of travel</p>
<p>member what Catherine says in Wutbering Heights ?
But there, never mind, when mj bird wings free, I
know its resting place. I know it. You see ? The ones
that have gone ‚Äî they changed little ; but strangely
and instantaneously. And now they thrid some ^er
air, have rarer senses, and their tap is heard on walls
of the mind that are scarcely there, so tenuous they
are. Not that I want proof. And such proof ! I
know it. And when your time comes, I give you my
invitation now. What is that old phcenix of ours ?
Do you suppose we could snare him, cage him ; tie
him to a perch ? Isn‚Äôt he in our very minds ? How
then ? Could we be else than wanderers ? May we
be forgiven for this futile waste of its powers.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúI suppose I was a little taken aback by this out-
pouring. For she leaned her face into her hands and
laughed.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòJust ‚Äòhysteria,‚Äô you are thinking/ she said sud-
denly,looking up atmefromthem. I sat in the shadow
now, so perhaps my face was not too clearly visible.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòBut what is this coming back ?‚Äô I stupidly ques-
tioned.</p>
<p>f‚Äò ‚ÄòOh, but you don‚Äôt understand,‚Äô she cried, turning
breathlessly on me. ‚Äò It is here now. And then, shall I
not see ? shall I not know ? and probably before the
very last of these leaves is fallen ? Oh, how I detest the
sentimentality they talk ; fobbing us off with their
precious stones and golden harps. Symbols if you
like, but beyond any poor earthly spirit‚Äôs hope or
desire. If we humans have climhed to where we are
‚Äî though I don‚Äôt believe it ‚Äî by way of the happy
and innocent animals, do you suppose we are going</p>
<p>THE BIRD OF TRAVEL I55</p>
<p>to suddenly jump half-a-dozen stories instead of as-
cending on and on and on ? What is space but the all
lam? What is time but the all I was and shall be ?
I cannot express myself, but if you could hear the
roaring of the fire here, you would not be wanting any
words. Never in the whole of my reading, in the
whole queer skein of things caUed my life ‚Äînever have
I encountered a single human being who expressed a
tenth of the sheer delight of sharing ‚Äî well, say, just
that bit of garish moon in this tiny bowl of the
world‚Äôs greenery. ‚ÄòBlind,‚Äô ‚Äòungrateful,‚Äô ‚Äòwornis of
earth,‚Äô no word in the language could express our
fatuity. Then I shall be free. . . But there, it‚Äôs time,
as the old Scottish ballad says, you were awa‚Äô. And
it‚Äôs time, as some less anonymous poet says, I sought
my couch. I confess I hated the very sight of you
when I saw you trespassing in my woods. Another
hereditary taint. But you have forgiven me . . . and I
will walk a little distance with you on your way.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúWell, I confess, her vehemence had stirred up
my sluggish mind a good deal more even than had the
bird before her. I followed her all but in silence. We
came to a kind of alley, its yew hedge long untended,
though the light of the moon pierced through upon its
sward.</p>
<p>‚Äú She paused, her face averted. ‚Äò And now ‚Äô ‚Äî she
said, ‚Äògoodbye, for this life. Yours that way; mine
this. Andmayall thatis meant by heaven be withyou.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúI did as I was bid. Silence crept in upon me
‚Äî ^an entire world ‚Äî like a dangerous flood. The
grass was hoar with a moonlight almost as white as
snow. The years seemed to melt away like a dream.</p>
<p>156 THE BIRD OF T R A V E I.</p>
<p>and, as I turned, seeing her there still waiting, I rea-
lised that she herself must have devised this echo of
our first and only other meeting. The strange rapt
face looked curiously unreal. With queer contrary
thoughts in my mind, I gazed across at her, not more
trustful of my eyes perhaps in that uncertain light than
I had been of my ears earlier in the evening. She did
not stir. All perfecdy still things seem to have a look
of agelessness and of the eternal. And then ‚Äî I turned
on my heel, and when, now no longer a shy awkward
siUy boy, I looked back as of old and for the last time ;
again it was in vain. She UuS gone. &hellip;‚Äù</p>
<p>So this, it appeared was aU. This was the story of
‚ÄúThe Wood‚Äù ! We others glanced a little uncom-
fortably at one another, I remember, at this crisis in
the evening‚Äôs talk ‚Äî a poet‚Äôs story in sober earnest :
incoherent, obscure, unreal, unlifeHke, without an
ending.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd the Bird ?‚Äù cried one of us, maybe a little
more ‚Äúfatuous ‚Äù than the rest. The old man was at that
moment beckoning to the Club waiter, and appeared
not to have noticed the question. And nobody, it
seemed, had either the stupidity or the courage to
add, ‚ÄúAnd what, pray, are jo// waiting for ?‚Äù</p>
<p>THE BOWL</p>
<p>I T was one autumn evening ‚Äî in the month of
October, I think, for I can just remember that
the thin gold and tawny beechleaves were still
floating down in the garden in the hazy sunshine,
and that already a fire burned in the grate to cheer the
colder twilights, when first my very young eyes fell
in wonder upon Mrs. Orchardson‚Äôs silver bowl.
Perhaps it had always been there, and always as
conspicuous. But it was now, I am sure, that I first
noticed it. It stood on the sideboard beside a cut-
glass decanter reflecting the ruddy colour of its wine
in the smooth cheeks of its two laughing Cupids. It
had handles, two pendant rings as plain in workman-
ship as the buckle on a child‚Äôs shoe. I stood and
stared up at it, as young eyes will at any such magical
object. There was a sort of secret jollity in the very
look of it ‚Äî an air to blow bubbles in, cool as an or-
chard, or as the half-hidden vaUeysof a summer cloud.</p>
<p>I was astonished at it, entranced by it ; longed to
touch and handle it, and even felt, I verily believe,
a kind of covetousness and an envy of the friend
whose bowl it was. And if I had been a jackdaw of
equal proportions to myself, I should certainly have
carried it off to hide in the chimney or hole in the
wail, wherever my nest might be. As it was, I at
least carried off a very vivid remembrance of it in my
mind ‚Äî ^which, fortunately, in a world hedged about
with a superfluity of Dont‚Äôs, is not a felony.</p>
<p>Anyhow, when one dark rainy morning the sharp
need came for something of this kind, it was I who</p>
<p>T H B BOWL</p>
<p>Ij8</p>
<p>thought of the bowl, which, after all, could contain
almost as much Jordan water as could the freestone
font in St. Barnabas‚Äôs, and was twenty times more
beautiful.</p>
<p>All through the night, while I had been placidly
asleep, I learned at my lonely breakfast, my friend
Mrs. Orchardson‚Äôs little baby had been simply burn-
ing like a coal at death‚Äôs door. It was a most interest-
ing and enthralling piece of news. And I‚Äôm not so
sure that I did not speculate how it was that in my
long nocturnal journeyings in the wilds of dream-
land, I had not heard its wallin^ cries as it, too, a
much smaller spirit, ran along into the shadowy
valley. For after all, abstractions like death are for
a child little more than a vague and menacing some-
thing in a dream.</p>
<p>Mrs. Orchardson‚Äôs baby had, of course, been sick-
ening for some little time past. I had been angry and
jealous more than once because it had been the cause
of my seeing very little of her, and of my being enter-
tained good deal Jess than I thought proper on so
short a visit. I could remember well enough its little
blue-eyed puckered face and slatey-blue eyes, with an
expression in them too, almost as dull as slate. Indeed,
one morning, not long before ‚Äî an unusually hot
morning for October ‚Äî she and I and it had sate on a
rug in the garden together under the elms. A few
withered wild flowers still showed in the grass, I
remember, with nothing but their swollen seed
vessels left of their summer.</p>
<p>And I had noticed, too, how peculiar a shiningness
had come into Mrs. Orelmdson‚Äôs grey eyes when she</p>
<p>. THE BOWL 159</p>
<p>talked to het baby. Yet anxiety kept her forehead
frowning even while she was smiling, as she stared
down into its small ugly wizened face. I didn‚Äôt think
it was in the least a pretty baby, and was vexed at its
persisting in being ill.</p>
<p>These last few days, indeed, I had been left almost
entirely to myself, with nobody to say a woid to,
except Esther, the parlourmaid ‚Äî a sandy-coloured
woman with a thick down on her face ‚Äî and now
and then to Mrs. Orchardson‚Äôs cook, who had a way
of speaking to me as if I were a kind of clockwork
image incapable of even hearing her words. &lsquo;‚ÄòAnd
how is the poor little infant this morning ?‚Äù I asked
her once, mimicking the old doctor. She looked at me
as if I were a snake in the grass ‚Äî -as no doubt I was .</p>
<p>But to come back to the silver bowl again. I had
finished my bread and milk, had for the third time
shooed away the cat from getting on to the table,
and now sat staring through the long rainy window
with my spoon in my mouth, when the door opened,
and Mrs. Orchardson put her face in at it. It was
gray, almost like wet chalk, and her eyes were so
sharp and far-off-looking that she seemed scarcely to
be aware of me at aU. She was certainly looking at
me, and yet as if through me, and with almost as
horrified an expression as if she could see the very
bones in my body. And then, suddenly she came in,
almost fell down on her knees beside my chair, clasped
me round, and hid her face in my lap. ‚ÄúO, Nick, Nick,
you poor lonely thing,‚Äù she said, sobbing, ‚Äúshe is
worse, much, much worse. She is dying.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúOb, dear !‚Äù 1 said in a mournful voice, ‚Äúoh, dear 1‚Äù</p>
<p>l6o T H E B O W L</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo you wiJl just try,‚Äù she went on hurriedly, as
if she were saying something that at any moment
might be forgotten, ‚Äúyou will just try to be quiet and
happy, by yourself. It won‚Äôt be long ; not very long.‚Äù
She paused, and I sat on as still as the loaf of bread
on the table. She did not seem even to be breathing.
But in a minute or two she lifted her wet face from
my pinafore, and was looking entirely different from
herself. I should hardly have recognised her ‚Äî and
yet she was quite calm, though her cheeks were
almost like clay and her eyes as if they had fallen a
little back into her head. ‚ÄúA&rsquo;^d ^ow, you see,‚Äù she
added, as if not to me at all, ‚ÄúMr. Cairns is coming to
christen her, to make her God‚Äôs little child. As
you are, Nick.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it going to be taken to Church, then ?‚Äù I
said in a sepulchral voice.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she answered, listening, but not to me.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut why ?‚Äù I said in disappointment. She put her
hands to my cheeks, cupping my chin in them, and
simply looking at me.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut,‚Äù I said wriggling away, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no font
here : there must be a font like as at Church.‚Äù I
frowned, looking at her a little scornfully out of the
corner of my eye. ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt be much good, if you
don‚Äôt. At least that‚Äôs what Esther says.‚Äù</p>
<p>She only shook her head, stiU gazing at me, and
listening, ‚Äúi know !‚Äù I said, ‚Äúwill that big silver
bowl on the sideboard do for a font, Mrs. Orchard-
son ? It‚Äôs a very big bowl.‚Äù</p>
<p>She smiled at me Brightly.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy, of course, you strange creature, that will</p>
<p>THE BOWL</p>
<p>i6x</p>
<p>do beautifully And now ‚Äù She got up,</p>
<p>and stood looking for a moment out of the window,
as if she had forgotten my presence altogether. ‚ÄúIn
all this loveliness !‚Äù she almost whispered, though all
thatshecouldseewasjustanordinary wetmorning. . .</p>
<p>Dr. Sharp would not return again for an hour, so
there were only Mrs. Orchardson, and Esther and
Mr. Cairns in the bedroom besides myself and the
baby. The cook, I heard, wouldn‚Äôt come, because
she was afraid of being upset. That seemed silly to
me. When I went into the room, a little square table
already stood between the fire and the sunshine, and
it was covered with a linen napkin with a fringe.
On this were burning two tall white candles in silver
sticks ; and in the midst was the bowl with a little
water in it which by tiptoeing I could just manage to
see. I stared betv&rsquo;^een surprise and dismay at Mr.
Cairns when he came in in his surplice. He seemed
to be a person absolutely different from the two Mr.
Cairns, I knew already ‚Äî the one a smiling but rather
siUy-smiling elderly man in his old clerical clothes
in the Vicarage garden ; the other, of course, looking
almost artificial, as he stood intoning the service in
church.</p>
<p>Having blown out the candles, and placed them on
the dressing table ; he signed to us to stand up, my-
self being between Mrs. Orchardson and Esther, and
the baby lying still and scarlet and open-eyed and
without a single sound in Mrs. Orchardson‚Äôs arms.
Once I remember, as he leaned over towards her, Mr.
Cairn‚Äôs surplice brushed my cheek with its peculiar
dry perfume of cambric. And when he dipped his</p>
<p>THE B O L</p>
<p>162</p>
<p>fingets into the bowl I saw the watet-buttcrflics jig
on the ceiling.</p>
<p>He did not seem to have noticed that I was there,
though for a moment or two his glasses blazed on
me Hke lanterns when he fronted the window. He
took the little baby in his great hands. It had begun
to cry then. But its crying was more Hke a very, very
old woman‚Äôs than a natural baby‚Äôs, and the fingets it
spread out in the air an instant were Hke white
match-sticks, they were so thin and shrunken. I
smiled at it and made a grimace to please it, but it
looked at me Hke purple glass, as i: it was not there
to see me or to be amused.</p>
<p>When the service was done, Mr. Cairns stooped
down and kissed the baby and he looked a very old
man indeed ; and yet when he stood up again and had
taken off his stole and surpHce, he was exactly the
same as when I had seen him reading in his garden.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy dear, dear lady, you must not grieve over-
much,‚Äù he said to Mrs. Orchardson, at the door of the
bedroom, ‚ÄúHe knows His lambs, all His lambs. And
He is merciful.‚Äù</p>
<p>He leant his chin, and smiled towards me with a
curious wrinkle on his face. His brown eyes remin-
ded me of berries. They were full of kindness
even though the look in them was not very attentive.
1 whispered to Esther, asking if I might be allowed
to carry the silver bowl downstairs again. And all
she gave me was a sharp shake of the head and a
greenish look, because I don‚Äôt think she Hked to say
no while Mr. Cairns was in hearing. He must have
heard what I said, because he put his fingers on my</p>
<p>THE BOWL 163</p>
<p>hair and smiled at me again, so that I had to go
downstairs in front of him, and I think he must have
told Mrs. Orchardson meanwhile what to do with
the bowl and the water.</p>
<p>In the hall he talked for a minute or two in secret
with Esther. ‚ÄúIn that case send the little boy to me,
then,‚Äù I heard him say. ‚ÄúMrs. Cairns will be at home.
Poor tiny lamb ! To think it must have suffered like
you and me !‚Äù Esther shut her fair-lashed eyes a
moment as if to show it would be a mercy if the
baby did die, and then opened them again very stern
and mournfully when she saw me watching her.</p>
<p>Yet in my heart of hearts I was perfectly sure that
Mrs. Orchardson‚Äôs little baby would not die. I can-
not tell whence this assurance came. It may have
been the fruit of a child‚Äôs natural intuition ; or even
of his exquisite eyesight ‚Äî experienced, as it would
seem, to see through, and not only on the surface.
But for one thing, I had all along felt a firm belief in
the inherent virtue of the bowl, and was contemp-
tuous of Esther for shutting her eyes like that. It
seemed impossible that the clear shallow water in its
shadowy deeps should not wash all taint of sickness
away. Besides, I had thought of it.</p>
<p>This, I think was the reason why 1 Hatly refused to
accept Mr. Cairns‚Äôs invitation to go to the Rectory,
when Esther told me to do so. I knew perfectly well
she wouldn‚Äôt be able to make me go against my will
while the baby was so ill. At last she gave a furious
empty toss with my gray wool scarf that she was
carrying in her hand, and looked at me as if no
ton^e could express her hatred.</p>
<p>THE BOWL</p>
<p>164</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt you feel no pity for that poot suffering
mite upstairs, you obstinate boy ?‚Äù she asked me in a
low compressed voice. I merely stared at her without
answering, and she had to turn her eyes away.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe don‚Äôt even know‚Äô‚Äô the meaning of the word !‚Äù
she said, and shut the door of the dining-room after
her as if she hoped its wood would stick for ever
after to the lintel. But I did not mind her temper.
Presently she came in again, looking even angrier and
whiter than before.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIs this the time for building and Noah‚Äôs-arking,‚Äù
she almost shouted in my ear r s I &ldquo;iat on the hearth-
rug; ‚Äúis this the time? ‚Äî w&rsquo;hen that poor little innocent
is rattling its very life out over your head ?‚Äù</p>
<p>I looked no further up at her than at the tray in her
hand. ‚ÄúYou Little imp !‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI suppose when it gets well, it will have to be
christened all over again, properly, won‚Äôt it ?‚Äù I en-
quired. I knew she was staring at me, and hating me
for not caring w&rsquo;^hat she said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhere,‚Äù ‚Äî she gasped almost losing herself in her
rage, ‚Äúwhere you pick up such evil heathenish no-
tions from, I can‚Äôt think. Not from this house.
There‚Äôs not a speck of sin left in the whole of that
infant‚Äôs body now ; not a speck. And if you had
gone to that kind Mr. Cairns as he arst, he would
have told vou so.‚Äù</p>
<p>J</p>
<p>‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to go, and Mrs. Orchardson wouldn‚Äôt
have tried to make me.‚Äù The blood seemed to
rise up in my body and I could hear my own voice
growing more insolent and trumpeting every mo-
ment. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs more. Miss Esther, I don‚Äôt believe a</p>
<p>bit in your old holy water. It isn‚Äôt going to die, and
even if you hope it will, it won‚Äôt. And you‚Äôre tread-
ing on one of my animals.‚Äù</p>
<p>At that she deliberately kicked down the fort I was
building with her foot.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou are a little devil incarnate ; that‚Äôs what you
ate,‚Äù she screamed at me, if one can scream without
raising one‚Äôs voice. ‚ÄúA little devil. You ought never
to have been allowed in a Christian house. It‚Äôs Tophet
and the roaring flames that you‚Äôre bound for, my
young man. You‚Äôve mirdered thzt poor mite. You
mark my words !‚Äù</p>
<p>I was so much enraged at this that I hit at a little
bulge in her boot with one of my bricks.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a beast,‚Äù I bawled at her in a voice no
louder than her own. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a filthy beast. And I
don‚Äôt mind where I go, so long as aren‚Äôt there.
Not a ‚Äî not a dam ‚Äô‚Äô .‚Äù</p>
<p>Her face was so close to mine in its hatred that I
saw her eyes change, and her lips stiffen, as if she
was afraid. ‚ÄúYou wait. Master Nicholas ; you wait !
For that vile horrid word! You wait! The niastef&rsquo;
shall hear of that.‚Äù</p>
<p>I laughed at her sneeringly. ‚ÄúI dare you to say it
to him. He wouldn‚Äôt care ; he thinks you‚Äô ^ a stupid
hairy woman. And 1 think you‚Äôre batefuld&rsquo; She
lifted her hand and shut her eyes. &ldquo;O, my God,‚Äù she
said, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt stand it,‚Äù and all but ran out of the room.</p>
<p>)^en she was gone ‚Äî with the inside of my stom-
ach feeling as if it were on fire ‚Äî ^I climbed the stairs
to my bedroom, and, boots and all, flung myself
down on the white quilt of the bed.</p>
<p>THE BOWL</p>
<p>l66</p>
<p>Nothing happened. The house remained in silence.
A flying shower rattled on the window pane, and then
the sun returned and shone grey and golden on the
raindrops. And I hated everything I looked at. I
thought how I would kill Esther ; and how I would
kick her body when she was dead.</p>
<p>But gradu^y the furnace within me began to die
down, my ‚Äúthoughts‚Äù wandered away, and my eye-
lids were drooping into a drowse when I heard a
muffled sound of footsteps to and fro, to and fro,
ascending from the bedroom immediately beneath
me, and I remembered the baoy. And suddenly a
dark shivering horror turned me to ice, and there, as
I lay, I prayed to be forgiven for having been myself,
and implored God to let me take its sufferings or to die
instead ofit. So I lay; flat on my stomach, and prayed.</p>
<p>The afternoon had now grown a little darker in the
room, and in a while after this, I must have emptily
fallen asleep. For the next thing I remember is
finding a cold arm round me in the dregs of the dusk
and lips close to my face softly whispering and mur-
muring, their soft warm breath on my cheek.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGuess, Nick ! Guess I‚Äù said that soft, thrilling
voice, when I stirred a little neater. ‚ÄúGuess I‚Äù</p>
<p>I put back my head, and by staring close could
just see the light from the window reacted in Mrs.
Orchardson‚Äôs eyes. A curious phosphorescence was
there too ; even her skin seemed very faintly to shine.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs much better.‚Äù</p>
<p>At which those eyes gazed through the narrow air
between us as incredulously as if at an angel. ‚ÄúYou
knew it ; you knm it ? You precious holy thing !</p>
<p>THE BOWL</p>
<p>167</p>
<p>And all this while you have been brooding up here
by yourself. What can I say ? How can I tell you ?
Oh, Nick, I shall die of happiness.‚Äù</p>
<p>She squeezed herself closer to me in the vacant
space on the bed, clasping me round ‚Äî her shoulders
shaking with what just for a minute I thought was
laughing.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI never can say how, Mrs. Orchardson I man-
aged to murmur after a long pause. ‚ÄúBut I was quite
sure, you know. I don‚Äôt think grown-up people
understand.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd I don‚Äôt, either,‚Äù she said with a little hyster-
ical laugh. ‚ÄúIndeed, indeed I don‚Äôt. But there ‚Äî ‚Äô‚Äôshe
raised her face, sat up, put her hands to her hair, and
smiled down on me. I too scrambled up ; and could
see her plainly now as if by a thin mist-like light
from her own body. ‚ÄúBless me, Nick, I have made
your hair all wet with crying. God bless you, my
dear. It was aU you ; all you.‚Äù</p>
<p>She satin silence a moment, but not as if she was
thinking. Then suddenly she breathed, and lifted-
her head. ‚ÄúAnd now I must go, and we mustn‚Äôt
make the teeniest tiniest little crick ot a sound. She
is asleep. Follow me down ‚Äî just two shadows. And
don‚Äôt, Nick, don‚Äôt let me vanish away.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWiU everything,‚Äù I asked her when we were
safely downstairs ; ‚Äúwill everything be just as ordin-
arily again now, Mrs. Orchardson ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou have missed me, you dear thing ?‚Äù she
asked, glancing over her shoulder, in the glaring
light that now stretched down on us. She was
kneeling at the sideboard.</p>
<p>T H B BOWL</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ l68</p>
<p>‚ÄúEsther never says a word, except to make me
hate her,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúSo, of course, most what she
-says about me is true. So I think now that the baby‚Äôs
quite better, Mrs. Orchardson, I had better go home
again. Even ^fr. Cairns wouldn‚Äôt let me carry the
bowl downstairs. And if it hadn‚Äôt been for that. . . ‚Äù</p>
<p>The blue of her eyes shone across at me like bits of
the sky seen through a window. They opened wider
and wider. ‚ÄúBut, Nick, my dear !‚Äù she cried at last,
clear and small as a bird. ‚ÄúI hadn‚Äôt a notion that you
had been unhappy. Indeed, indeed I hadn‚Äôt. Blind
selfish creature that I am. He Is si &lsquo;aking, poor darling.
He is absolutely worn out !‚Äù</p>
<p>And at that I could refrain my self-righteousness
and self-commiseration no longer. I ran over to her,
bowed myself double beside her on the floor, and
sobbed ‚Äúas if my heart would break.‚Äù</p>
<p>THE THREE FRIENDS</p>
<p>T he street was narrow ; yet, looking up, the
two old friends, bent on their accustomed
visit, could discern ‚Äî beyond a yellow light
that had suddenly shone out into the hushed gloom
fromanattic window ‚Äî the vast,accumulated thunder-
clouds that towered into the darkening zenith.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just it,‚Äù continued Mr. Eaves, more em-
phatically, yet more confidentially, ‚Äúit isn‚Äôt my health.
Sully. I‚Äôm not so much afraid of my health. It‚Äôs ‚Äî
it‚Äôs my &hellip;‚Äù He took off his hat and drew his
hand over his tall, narrow head, but pushed on no
further towards the completion of his sentence.</p>
<p>Mr. Sully eyed him stonily. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, then,‚Äù
he said. ‚ÄúWhy worry ? There‚Äôs worry enough in the
world, old sport, without dreaming about it.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI know,‚Äù said Mr. Eaves ; ‚Äúbut then, you see.</p>
<p>Sully ‚Äù They had paused at the familiar swing-</p>
<p>door, and now confronted one another in the opaque,
sultry silence. And as Mr. Sully stood for an instant in
close contact with his old crony in the accentuated
d^fkness of the mock-marble porch, it was just as if
a scared rabbit had scurried out of Mr.¬ªEaves‚Äôs long
white face.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLook here,‚Äù Mr. Sully exclaimed with sudden
frivolity, ‚Äúwee‚Äôll ask Miss Lacey‚Äô&rsquo; ; and was followed
by his feebly protesting companion into the bar.</p>
<p>The long black stuffed bench and oblong maho-
gany table, darkened here and there by nttle circular
pools of beer, stood close against the wall, and Mr.
Sully began to divulge his friend‚Äôs confidences even</p>
<p>M</p>
<p>lyo THE THREE FRIENDS</p>
<p>befoie Miss Lacey could bring them their glasses. A
commissionaire sat in the further bar, nodding over
an old newspaper ; and Mr. Eaves kept his eyes fixed
on his oblong lurching head, while he listened, fas-
cinated and repelled, to his friend‚Äôs facetiousness.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNow, supposing. Miss Lacey, my dear,‚Äù began
Mr. Sully shrewdly, half-closing his eyes as if to gloss
over his finesse, ‚Äúsupposing a young man, a nice,
curly-headed young man ‚Äî just about our old friend‚Äôs
age here‚Äù ‚Äî Miss Lacey, with a kind of arch and sym-
pathetic good-nature, leaned a large, dark head to
glance at Mr. Eaves ‚Äî ‚Äúsupposing a nice young gen-
tleman ‚Äî ^just as it might be our old friend himself
here ‚Äî came, like an innocent, to entrust to your
blessed bosom a secret ‚Äî a sacred secret : what would
you do ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúLot‚Äô bless me, Mr. Sully, sir, is that all you was
coming to 1 A secret ? Why, keep it, to be sure ;
and not the first time neether.‚Äù Miss Lacey advanced
to the bar, black, precise and cheerful, with the two
small, thick glasses in her hand.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGood,‚Äù said Mr. SuUy, with an almost profes-
sional abandon. ‚ÄúGood. So far. But step number
two ; supposing, my dear, you couldn‚Äôt for the life
and love of you ie/p him in his little difficulty ‚Äî de-
pendent on his secret, let‚Äôs say ‚Äî what then ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy, I‚Äôd keep it iil the more,‚Äù cried Miss Lacey
brightly.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA woman‚Äôs answer. Eaves ; and none the worse
for that,‚Äù said Mr. SuUy. ‚ÄúBut on the other hand,
supposing you were a practical‚Äù ‚Äî ^he paused with
the little water-jug hovering an inch or two abow</p>
<p>THE THREE FRIENDS I7I</p>
<p>his friend‚Äôs glass ‚Äî ‚Äúsupposing you were a practical,
unromantic old blackguard like me‚Äî why, you‚Äôd go
and tell it to the first lovely blooming creature that
came along.‚Äù He eyed her steadily yet jocosely.
‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm going to tell it to you, my dear 1‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúHow you do tease, to be sure !‚Äù said Miss Lacey.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a real tease, isn‚Äôt he, Mr. Eaves ?‚Äù</p>
<p>Mr. SuUy‚Äôs eyes suddenly sobered with over-
whelming completeness. He pointed coldly with his
stick. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been dreaming of hell,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Eaves, on his part, withdrew large, weak,
colourless eyes from the uneasy head of the commis-
sionaire, and turned them on Miss Lacey. She
glanced at him swiftly, then stooped, and took up a
piece of sewing she had laid down on her wooden
chair, in the little out-of-the-way bar.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt approve of such subjecs,‚Äù she said,
‚Äútreated frivolous.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúGracious goodness. Eaves,‚Äù said Mr. SuUy, ‚Äúshe
says ‚Äòfrivolous.‚Äô Hell ‚Äî ‚Äòfrivolous‚Äô !‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy,‚Äù said Miss Lacey lucidly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not so green
as I look.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWell, you couldn‚Äôt look younger, if being young‚Äôs
to be green,‚Äù said Mr. Sully ; ‚Äúand as sure, my dear,
as that was a flash of lightning, it ‚Äî it‚Äôs the real
thing.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Äô&lsquo;5^en the faint but cumulative rumble of thunder
that followed had subsided. Miss Lacey seemed to
have withdrawn her attention. Mr. SuUy edged
slowly round on his feet and faced his friend. ‚ÄúYou
old skeleton at the feast ! You‚Äôve alarmed the poor
ehild,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>l-jz THE THREE FRIENDS</p>
<p>Miss Lacey spoke without raising her eyes, bent
closely on her needle. &ldquo;Not me,‚Äù she said ; &ldquo;but I
don‚Äôt hold with such ideas.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúTell her yourself,‚Äù said Mr. Sully to his friend ;
‚Äútell her yourself : they never will believe me.‚Äù</p>
<p>Mr. Eaves shook his head.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy not ?‚Äù said Mr. Sully.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGod bless me,‚Äù said Mr. Eaves, with sudden
heat, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm old enough to be her father.‚Äù</p>
<p>Miss Lacey looked up over her sewing. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd
scarcely believe me‚Äù she said mysteriously ; ‚Äúbut
there was a young gendeman down Charles-street,
where I used to be, that had dreams ‚Äî well, there,
shocking ! Nobody but me had the patience to listen
to him. But you can‚Äôt give all your attention to one
customer, can you ? He,‚Äù she cast a curious glance
into the shadows brooding over the commissionaire
‚Äî‚Äúhe got up out of his bed one night, just as you or
me might ‚Äî he was living in private apartments, too
‚Äî struck a match, so they said, and cut his throat.
Awful. From ear to ear !‚Äù Her thimbled finger made
a demure half-circuit of the large pearls of her necklace.</p>
<p>Mr. SuDy gazed roundly. ‚ÄúDid he, though ? But
there, you see,‚Äù and he leant in great confidence
over the counter, ‚ÄúMr. Eaves here doesn‚Äôt shave I‚Äù</p>
<p>Mr. Eaves smiled vaguely, half-lifting his stick, as
if in coquettish acknowledgment of his friend‚Äôs jest.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo, no, old friend,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúnot that, not ^t,
I hope.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúGracious goodness,‚Äù said Mr. Sully cordially,
‚Äúhe mustn‚Äôt take it to heart like that. A dream‚Äôs a
dream.‚Äù</p>
<p>THE, THREE FRIENDS I75</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy, of course, it is,‚Äù said Miss Lacey. ‚ÄúYou
ought to take more care of yourself, sir ; didn‚Äôt he,
Mr. Sully ?‚Äù</p>
<p>Mr. Eaves gazed dispassionately, and yet with
some little dignity, in the isolation of attention he
had evoked. He turned slowly towards the bar, and
stooped a little- confidentially&rsquo;. ‚ÄúNot once, not
twice,‚Äù he said ruminatingly, ‚Äúbut every blessed
night. Every blessed night.‚Äù</p>
<p>Miss Lacey ey&rsquo;cd him with searching friendliness.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTell her,‚Äù said Mr. Sully, walking slowly and cir-
cumspectly to the door, and peeping out through the
cranny into the darkened street.</p>
<p>Mr. Eaves put his empty glass deliberately upon
the counter, drew his hand slowly across his lips and
shook his head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing to tell, when you come
to that. And &hellip;‚Äù he nodded a questioning head
towards the solitary occupant of the other bar.</p>
<p>‚ÄúObjfast; bless you,‚Äù said Miss Lacey. ‚ÄúAsreg‚Äôlar
as clockwork ‚Äî you‚Äôd hardly believe it.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe‚Äôll break his neck, some d.ay,‚Äù remarked Mr.
Sully tersely, ‚Äúwith that jerking.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou see, my dear,‚Äù continued Mr. Eaves trust-
fully, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind my old friend, Mr. Sully, making
a good deal of fun at my expense. He always has : eh.
Sully ? But he doesn‚Äôt see. You don‚Äôt see. Sully.
There the thing is ; and truth all over it. Facts are
facts ‚Äî in my belief.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut fire and brimstone, and suchlike ; oh no !‚Äù
said Miss Lacey with a dainty little shudder. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt
ctedit it, reelly ; oh no I And poor innocent infants,
too ! You may think of me what you like, but nothing
‚ÄôII make me Mieve that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>174 THE THREE FRIB.NDS</p>
<p>Mr. Sully looked over his shoulder at Mr. Eaves.
‚ÄúOh, that,‚Äù said his old friend, ‚Äúwas only Mr. SuUy‚Äôs
fiin. He says it‚Äôs HeU. I didn‚Äôt. My dream was oiily
‚Äî after ; the state after death, as they call it.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI see,‚Äù said Miss Lacey, lucidly, summoning all
her intelligence into her face.</p>
<p>Mr. Eaves leaned forward, and all but whispered
the curious tidings into her ear. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ‚Äî it‚Äôs just the</p>
<p>‚ÄúTlie same ?‚Äô‚Äô echoed Miss I.acey. ‚ÄúWhat ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe same,‚Äù repeated the old man, drawing back,
and looking out of his long, grey , meaningless face at
the little plump, bright, satiny woman.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHell ?‚Äù breathed Miss I.acey.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe state after death,‚Äù called Mr. Sully, still
peering into the gloom ‚Äî and stepped back rather
hurriedly in the intense pale lilac illumination of a
sudden flickering blaae of lightning.</p>
<p>Thunder now clanged directly overhead, and still
Mr. Eaves gazed softly yet earnestly into nothingness,
as if in deep thought.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhatever you like to call it,‚Äù he began again
steadily pushing his way, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs how I take it. I sit
with my wife, just the same; cap and ‚Äòfront ‚Äô and all,
just the same ; gas burning, decanter on the table,
books in the case, marble clock on the mantelpiece,
just the same. Or perhaps I‚Äôm walking in the street,
just the same ; carts and shops and dogs, all just the
same. Or perhaps I‚Äôm here, same as I might be now ;
with Sully there, and you there, and him there,‚Äù he
nodded towards the commissionaire. ‚ÄúAll just the
same. For ever, and ever, and ever.‚Äù He raised his</p>
<p>THE THREE FRIENDS</p>
<p>175</p>
<p>empty glass to his lips, and glanced almost apolo-
getically towards his old friend. ‚ÄúFor ever, and ever,‚Äù
he said, and put it down again.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe means,‚Äù said Mr. Sally, ‚Äúno change : like one
of those blessed things on the movies ; over and
over again, click, click, click, click, click ; you know.
I tell him it‚Äôs his sentence, my dear.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut if it‚Äôs the same,‚Äù Miss Lacey interposed,
with a little docile frown of confusion, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs
different ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMark me. Eaves, my boy,‚Äù cried Mr. Sully softly
at the door ; ‚Äúit‚Äôs the ladies for brains, af^ter all.
That‚Äôs what they call a poser. ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs different,‚Äô eh ?‚Äù</p>
<p>Mr. Eaves pondered in a profound internal silence
in the bar. And beyond the windows, the rain
streamed steadily in a long-drawn gush of coolness
and peace. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs different ?‚Äù repeated Mr. Sully,
rocking infinitesimally on his heels.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy,‚Äù said Mr. Eaves, ‚Äúit seems as if there I
can‚Äôt change ; can‚Äôt. If you were to ask me how I
know‚Äî why, I couldn‚Äôt say. It‚Äôs a dream. But that‚Äôs
what‚Äôs the difference. There‚Äôs nothing to come.
AW : why 1 I might change in a score of ways ; just
take them as they come. I might fall ill ; or Mrs.
Eaves might ; I might come into some money ; marry
again. God bless me, I might die ! But there, that‚Äôs
^ over; endless; no escape; nothing. I can‚Äôt even
die. I‚Äôm just meself. Miss Lacey ; Sully, old friend.
Just meself, for ever, and ever. Nothing but me
looking on at it all, if you take me ‚Äî just what I‚Äôve
made of it. It‚Äôs my‚Äù‚Äî his large pale eyes roved aim-
lessly ‚Äî ^‚Äúit‚Äôs just what Mr. SuSy says, I suppose ; it‚Äôs</p>
<p>176 THE THREE fRIENDS</p>
<p>my sentence. Eh, Sully ? wasn‚Äôt that it? My sen-
tence?‚Äù He smiled courageously.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSentence, oh no ! Sentence ? You !‚Äù cried Miss
Lacey incredulously. ‚ÄúHow coxild you, Mr. Sully ?
Sentence 1 Whatever for, sir ?‚Äù</p>
<p>Mr. Eaves again glanced vaguely at the sleeper,
and then at his friend‚Äôs round substantial shoulders,
rigidly turned on him. He fixed his eyes on the clock.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôve never done no harm, Mr. Eaves 1‚Äù cried
Miss Lacey, almost as if in entreaty.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou see,‚Äù said the old gentleman, glancing over
his shoulder, ‚Äúit isn‚Äôt what y&rsquo;^u do : so I seem to take
it.‚Äù Mr. Sully half turned from the door, as if to
listen. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what you are,‚Äù said Mr. Eaves, as if to
himself.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy, according to that,‚Äù said Miss Lacey, in
generous indignation, ‚Äúwho‚Äôs safe ?‚Äù</p>
<p>A day of close and tepid weather followed the storm.
But it was on the evening of the next day after that
‚Äî ^an evening of limpid sunshine and peace, the spar-
rows chirping shrilly in the narrow lights and
shadows of the lane, that Mr. Sully came in to see
Miss Lacey.</p>
<p>She was alone : and singing a little quiet tune to
herself as she went about her business. He shook his
head when she held up two glasses ; and raised just
one forefinger.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs dead,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOh, no !‚Äù cried Miss Lacey.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis morning &hellip;. in his sleep,‚Äù He |;a2ed at
her with an unusual ‚Äî with a curiously fish-hke con-
centration.</p>
<p>THE THEEE friends I77</p>
<p>‚ÄúPoor poor, gentleman,‚Äù said Miss Lacey. He was
a gentleman, too ; and no mistake. Never a hard
word for nobody ; man, woman, or child. Always
the same. But it‚Äôs shocking. Well, well. But how
dreadfully sudden, Mr. Sully, sir !‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù said Mr. Sully almost irri-
tably. ‚ÄúAnd if so, where‚Äôs the change ?‚Äù His round
shoulders seemed with slight effort almost to shrug
themselves.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGoodness gracious,‚Äù Miss Lacey cried, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt
mean ‚Äî you don‚Äôt mean to think ‚Äî you don‚Äôt say it‚Äôs
true ? What he was telling us, Mr. Sully ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm not so sure,‚Äù her visitor replied vaguely,
almost stubbornly. ‚ÄúWhere else, after all, knowing
all that, why, where else could h&amp; go ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMr. Eaves, Mr. Sully ? Him ? oh, no !‚Äù</p>
<p>Mr. Sully, in the intense clear quiet of the bar,
continued to stare at her in a manner something like
that of an over-glutted vulture. He nodded.</p>
<p>Miss Lacey‚Äôs kind brown eyes suddenly darkened
as if with a gust of storm. ‚ÄúBut, then, what about
us ?‚Äù she cried piteously, and yet with the tenderest
generosity.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWell,‚Äù said Mr. Sully, opening the door, and
looking out into the sunny evening air, ‚Äúif you ask
me, that‚Äôs merely a question of time.‚Äù</p>
<p>LISPET, LISPETT AND VAINE</p>
<p>K AUNDERs‚Äôs little clear morning town was</p>
<p>j\ / 1 busy with dogs and tradesmen and carri-
X V X ages. It wore an almost chiJd-like vivacity
and brightness, as if overnight it had been swept and
garnished for entranceable visitors from over the sea.
And there ‚Äî in the blowy sunshine, hke some gro-
tesque Staffordshire figure on a garret chimney-piece
‚Äî there, at the street corner, sat so ludicrous an old
man that one might almost have described him as
mediaeval.</p>
<p>A peak cap, of a slightly marine, appearance, was
drawn down over his eyes. Beneath it, wisps of grey
hair and a thin beard helplessly shook in the wind ;
and before him stood a kind of gaping wallet, of
cracked American cloth, held yawningly open by its
scissor-legs.</p>
<p>From this receptacle, ever and again, he extracted
a strand of his dyed bast, or dubiously rummaged in
its depths for his scissors. Whereupon he would gin-
gerly draw the strand between his lips ‚Äî a movement
that positively set one‚Äôs teeth on edge ‚Äî and at the
same moment he would cast a bleated, long, casual
glance first down the street to his right ‚Äî High Street;
and then up the street to his left ‚Äî Mortimer Street ;
as the bast drew him round.</p>
<p>I had watched him awhile from under the canvas
window-blind of Lister Owlett‚Äôs, the Curio Shop, in
which my friend Maunders was chaffering with a dark
sardonic-looking man over a piece of Sheffield plate,
and, at last, with that peculiar mixture of shame, com&gt;</p>
<p>LISPET, LISPETT AND VAINE I79</p>
<p>passion, amusement, and horror which such ineflfec-
tual (thoughpossibly not unhappy) beings produce on
one, I had crossed the road and had purchased an ab-
surd little doll bast marketing basket. Oddly, too,
c^ter I had actually selected my specimen, and had
even paid its price, the queer remote old creature had
insisted on my taking a rather more ornate example
of his wares</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou know. Maunders,‚Äù I said, when we were a
hundred yards or so beyond the old gentleman‚Äôs
pitch,‚Äúthis thing isn‚Äôt at aU badly made. The pattern
is rather pretty, and there‚Äôs a kind of useless finish to
it. There‚Äôs still something to be said for the amateur.
Anyhow, Bettie will like it.‚Äù</p>
<p>Maunders turned his long, large, palish face of his
and looked at me with his extraordinary eyes. For the
ninety-ninth time at least I noticed that their faint
blue and his necktie‚Äôs azure called each to each, as
deep calls to deep.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAmateur !‚Äù he echoed blandly, though a peculiar
fixity of attention had gathered into his gaze ; ‚Äúwhy,
that old gentleman is the last of ‚Äî of the Lispets.‚Äù
He turned his head away ‚Äî a queer-shaped, heavy head
‚Äî and added : ‚ÄúQuite the last.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúLispets, Maunders ; what are they ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy dear K , believe me,‚Äù said Maunders al-</p>
<p>most mincingly, ‚Äúnot everything is a jest. You must
now have trodden the streets of this small town at
least a dozen times. The Works ‚Äî what remains of
them ‚Äî are not seven miles off. And yet, here you are,
pleasantly fluting that you have lived a life of such
obscurity as never to have heard of Lispet, Lispett,</p>
<p>l8o LISPET, LISPETT AKt) VAINE</p>
<p>and Vaine‚Äôs. It‚Äôs an affectation. I can scarcely forgive
you. Nor will Henrietta.‚Äù</p>
<p>He was ‚Äî as usual ‚Äî gently thrusting-out beforehim
his handsome malacca cane in a manner which fre-
quently persuaded approaching pedestrians that he
was blind. And he repeated sotto vo:e^ and as if out of
an ocean of reflection, ‚Äú ‚ÄòLispet, Lispett and Vaine ;
Mercers to Their Majesties . . . ‚Äô I wish I could re-
member exactly how the old title went. In latter times,
I mean.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWho were ‚Äòtheir Majesties,‚Äô then ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòTheir Majesties‚Äô ? ‚Äù said Maunders. ‚ÄúOh, mere
kings and queens. In the Firm‚Äôs heyday they were, of
course, the crowned heads of practically the whole
barbaric globe. But what is history ‚Äî mummified fact;
desiccated life ; the irretrievable. You are merely one
of the crowd who care not tuppence for such things.
The present generation ‚Äî with its Stores and Empor-
iums and Trusts and ‚ÄòCombines‚Äô ‚Äî is blind to the
merest inkling of what the phrase Merchant Prince
implies. We are not even conscious of irony in little
Tommy Tucker‚Äôs Nation of Shopkeepers. Other times,
better manners. The only ‚Äòentirely honest merchant‚Äô
of late years ‚Äî so far as I have definitely heard ‚Äî is
bones in Shirley graveyard. StiU, the Lispet tradition
was not one of mere honesty.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat, then,‚Äù said I.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWell, in the first place,‚Äù replied Maunders, slid-
ing me a remote ruminative glance, ‚Äúit rambles baxik
almost to prehistoric times. You may himt down the
aboriginals of the Firm for yourself, if you fed so in-
clined. They appear to have been Phoenicians. Tyre,</p>
<p>LISPET, LISPETT AND VAINE l8l</p>
<p>maybe, but I gather non-Semitic. Some remote B.C.
glasswork in the Egyptian galleries of the British Mu-
seum bears their ‚Äòmark‚Äô‚Äî two inverted V‚Äôs with a
kind of P between. There are others ‚Äî a cone ‚Äòsup-
ported by‚Äô two doves ; a running hound, a crescent
moon, and a hand ‚Äî just a slim, ungrasping hand. Such
marks have been discovered, they say, woven into
mummy linen, into Syrian embroidery, Damascus
silks, and tapestry from the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe priestesses of Astaroth, according to Bateson,
danced in gauze of L. L. and V.‚Äôs handiwork. They
exploited the true bombyx ages before Ptolemy ; their
gold thread gleamed on the Ark of the Covenant ;
and it was fabric of their weaving in which the
Queen of Sheba marvelled before Solomon. The shoes
of his apes, sewn-in with seed pearls and splinters of
amethyst were . But what‚Äôs the good of chatter-</p>
<p>ing on like this ? I‚Äôm not,‚Äù groaned Maunders with
a muffled yawn, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a perambulating encyclo-
paedia. Some old pantaloon of a German, long before
Bateson, burrowed in true German fashion into the
firm‚Äôs past. You may go to bed with his book, if you
like ‚Äî this very night. And then, of course, there ate
one or two of their old ledgers and curios in the local
Museum. But I‚Äôm not an antiquarian. My only point
is that Jiie past even of a soapboiler is none the worse
for being the distant past. What‚Äôs more, they knew i
in those days that objects arc only of value when rep-
resentative of subjects. Has it never occurred to you
(no, I suppose not) that the Wisest‚Äôs apes, ivory, and
peacocks were symbolical ? The apes representing, of
course ‚Äù</p>
<p>i 82 lispet, lispett and vaine</p>
<p>‚ÄúOf bourse&rsquo;* I interrupted hurriedly. ‚ÄúButwhatFm
after, Maimders, is something faintly resembling mat-
ter-of-fact. These Lispet people ‚Äî what is redly their
history ? Subsequent, I mean, to the Apocrypha on
which you have already drawn. Honestly, that path-
etic old guy with the pouch of bast at the corner
rather interested me.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Äú Drawn on !‚Äô he says,‚Äù drawledMaunders.‚Äú When
I have not even distantly referred to Joseph‚Äôs Coat,or
that she-devil Jezebel‚Äôs headress, or to the Grand
Khan, or to the Princess Assinimova, or to the tanned
Barbary kid cuirass of steel and emeralds in which
Saladin met his end. A Firm that, apart from clients
celebrated in Holy Writ, once happily wrote off bad
debts incurred with such customers as Semiramis,
Sappho, Paris, and the Arch ‚Äî or, as we amused mod-
erns suppose, the exceedingly arch ‚Äî Druids, might
well boast ‚Äî though it didn‚Äôt ‚Äî not only of its repute
but also of its catholicity.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo, no‚Äù ; he mooned slowly about him. ‚ÄúYour
precious old ‚Äòmatter-of-fact‚Äô ! As if you were a clerk
in unholy orders, as if you bought your boots in
Scotland Yard, as if you were a huckster of hardware.
By all means you sh^ have the facts. Butfor heaven‚Äôs
sake ‚Äî for heaven‚Äôs sake, precocious K , be care-</p>
<p>ful with them. A friend of mine (an earnest man)
was once given a fact, and it exploded ‚Äî in his bath-
room.‚Äù</p>
<p>Dangling the last-of-the-Lispet‚Äôs little basket on
my forefinger, I awaited the facts.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe point is,‚Äù Maunders murmured on, ‚Äúwhat of
the slightest interest to you can there be to say, of a</p>
<p>LISPET, LISPETT AND VAINE 183</p>
<p>fitm that is now dust, and that followed a tradition
which in these days would within six months clap
its partners into Bedlam or the Bankruptcy Court ?
You must confess that that kind of sweet reasonable-
ness, hardly less than the modern variety, is at last
death to any decent humanity. At long last, maybe.
And how divine a decay ! Anyhow, there they were
‚Äî and there, too, are the ruins of them, edging the
smooth sloping crest of Adderley Hill, on the other
side of the town. Henrietta shall take you there to-
morrow, if you‚Äôre a polite guest. She loves to expati-
ate on that kind of rubble ‚Äî the Failures.</p>
<p>‚ÄúStill, try to imagine .it, my dear K , in its</p>
<p>green and early days. A long range of low buildings,
part half-timbered Tudor, with a few wombed-in
bits of 13 th- and 14th-century work, and a fringe of
excellent 1 8th-century ‚Äî weathered and lovely mould-
ed brick. In its prime it must have been a ravishing
sight, with its hanging sign of faded blue and gold,
its walls and thatch, and shingles, cobbled alleys and
water-conduits, worn and mellow with the peace of
a thousand thousand sunsets, the mosses and rain-
stains and frost-flowerings of centuries of autumns
and winters ‚Äî just England‚Äôs history, moral and actual,
in antique stone and gable and mullion.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs as it may be. I have no wish to exaggerate.
There is no particular virtue in mere age ‚Äî except to
Ac imagination. StiU, your mere ‚Äòfacts‚Äô ate something
I suppose. The fact that they were spinning silk ‚Äî
here in England ‚Äî before the Conqueror came over.
The fact that they were world-renowned glovers long
before Elizabeth‚Äôs time. The fact that their Egyptian</p>
<p>184 LISPET, LISPETT AND VAINE</p>
<p>cotton must have been abob on the Mediterranean;
when Lancashire, please God, was a verdant solitude,
and forefathers, my poor dear, were gadding
about in woad.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey had their foreign agents, of course, netting
in handiwork from all over the globe, on which they
themselves set the final seal. I won‚Äôt labour the point, i
All I suggest is that you should ask a Bond Street
dealer to supply you with a Persian rug of L. L. and
V. workmanship. But avoid the First of April for the
enterprise. And yet, do you know, there was really
nothing at the root of them but ‚Äî well, a kind of in-
stinct : to keep themselves clean. Animals share it.
That, and the pride with which a single virtue darkens
and suffocates a man if he isn‚Äôt for ever toiling to
keep its growth under. The one secret of their stabil-
ity, of their being, and, in times past, of their success,
was simply this ‚Äî that nothing they should, would,
or could ever conceivably offer for sale need disturb
for a breath of a sob or the weight of a dewdrop the
ashes of their sleeping forefathers in Adderley Church-
yard. The like of which their forefathers had done by
their forefathers.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy, if the ancient Hebrew Jews bequeath the
very droop of their noses, why shouldn‚Äôt an old Eng-
lish ‚ÄòHouse‚Äô bequeath its tradition ? They believed ‚Äî
not Athanasian fashion but in their insides, so to
speak ‚Äî they believed in that perfect quality and con-
summate workmanship which, naturally, only exor-
bitant prices can assure . Exorbitant prices, mind you,
not profits. They valued their fair fame. Ordy what
was good enough for a Lispet could hope to satisfy a</p>
<p>LISPET, LISPETT AND VAINE iSj</p>
<p>partner who spelt his name with two t‚Äôs, and only
what satisfied a Lispett left unashamed the conscience
of a Vaine.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn plain Anglo-Saxon, the whole thing in decent
practical moderation was merely the positive forecast
of a Utopian dream. If ever you pass that way, rest
for a moment at the mouth of the WeU at the World‚Äôs
End. And drink, pretty creature. Perhaps you will dis-
cover a cone supported by two doves scrawled on the
bottom of its bronze bucket.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúPerhaps,‚Äù I echoed, as cheerfully as possible.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAt an extreme, of course, this tradition became
the very devil. I don‚Äôt say they made any claim to be
gentry, or that they refused any kind of exalted alli-
ance if nicely and unostentatiously proffered. There‚Äôs
an old tale of one of their apprentices who went sight-
seeing in the 14th century. Among other little ro-
mantic adventures, he hunted the Unicorn, got a siren
with child, fought a demon in Babylon, and bartered
tiaras with the reigning Pope in Avignon ‚Äî very much
at that precise moment at a loose end.</p>
<p>‚ÄúStill a tale‚Äôs only a tale, though none the worse
for that. You want naked facts ‚Äî a most indec-
orous variety ; and one of them is that during the
nearer centuries the three families riotously inter-
married, making the green one red, as the poet says.
They were self-sufficient ‚Äî ^like Leonardo. Except, of
course, that they were artists only in the sense that
they designed and distributed objects of flawless craft-
manship ; while he was a consummate craftsman only
by degree of his supreme art. And that was ‚Äî or was
not ‚Äî -between himself and the infinite, so to speak.‚Äù</p>

<p>l86 LISPET, LISPETT AND VAINE</p>
<p>*‚ÄòI love your ‚Äòso-to-speaks,‚Äô Maunders.‚Äù</p>
<p>*‚ÄòIt&rsquo;s very nice of you,‚Äù said Maunders. ‚ÄúBut
what I really want to say is that gradually the ‚Äòstand-
ing‚Äô of the Firm lost everything in the nature of the
precarious. Then, enter Beelzebub. Their only con-
ceivable corruption could come from within, in one
of two forms, putrefaction or petrifaction. Well, you
shall see. In their earlier annals they can never so
much as have tasted temptation to sink to trade
devices. Progress, on the other hand, was practically
denied to them. Their monopoly was the only one
to be had for the asking ‚Äî tneir integrity.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am not joking. Their wares were as innocent of
guile and as beautiful as the lilies of the field. All they
needed for mere prosperity was the status quo. Does
Nature ? The high and mighty sought them out for
precisely the same reason as a young man with imagin-
ation pursues that Will-o‚Äô-the-Wisp called Beauty.
Have you ever noticed how different a respect one
has for an advertised article and for an article whose
virtues have been sweetly absorbed into one‚Äôs soul ?</p>
<p>‚ÄúCompare, for instance, a cottage loaf with foie
gras ; or the Mr. Anon of the Scottish Ballads with
Sappho ; or Lord Loveaduck‚Äôs ‚Äòbrilliance‚Äô with Gam-
ma in Leo. Lispet, Lispett and Vaine would have as
gladly catalogued their goods as have asked for refer-
ences. Advertise i Why, a lady might as well advcr-^
tise her great-grandmother‚Äôs wig. They were mer-
chants of the one true tradition. Their profits were
fees. Their arrogance was beyond the imagination of
a Tamburlaine, and their ‚Äî ^what shall we call them ?
‚Äî their principles were as perennial as the secret</p>
<p>LISPET, LISPETT AND VAINE 187</p>
<p>springs of the Oceans. It was on similar principles
that Satan sold the fruit to Mother Eve.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI see,‚Äù said I. ‚ÄúIf one can. Maunders ‚Äî through a
haze of contradictions.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou cannot see,‚Äù said Maunders. ‚ÄúBut that is
simply because your modern mind is vitiated by the
conviction that you just pay a tradesman to sell you
a decent article, that you can with money buy quality.
You can‚Äôt. L. L. and V. merely graciously bestowed on
their customers the excellence of their wares, of their
‚Äògoods‚Äô in the true old meaning of the term ‚Äî a pecu- &rsquo;
liar something in the style and finish which only the
assurance of their history and their intentions ‚Äî their
ideals, if you like ‚Äî made possible.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGood heavens, man, isn‚Äôt there a kind of divin-
ation between one‚Äôs very soul and a thing decently
made ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs a granite Rameses, or a Chelsea
porringer ? The mere look of a scarf or a snippet of
damask or of lawn or of velvet, a stomacher or a
glove of L. L. and V. make is like seeing for the first
time a bush of blowing hawthorn or a nymph in a
dell of woodruff, when, say, you are nine. Or, for the
last, when you are nine-and-ninety.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy dear Maunders,‚Äù I smiled benignly. ‚ÄúWhat
on earth are you talking about ? I have always sup-
posed that speech was intended to disclose one‚Äôs
meaning. Nymphs 1‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWell,‚Äù replied Maunders, imperturbably shoving
his ‚ÄúSheffield‚Äù candlestick at last into his slate-cov-
ered greatcoat pocket ; ‚ÄúI merely mean that there is
a kind of goodness in good work. It confers a sort of
everlasting youth. Think of the really swagger old</p>
<p>l88 LISPET, LISPETT AND VAINE</p>
<p>boys wc call the masters. What do you actually get out
of them ? The power to be momentarily immortal,
that‚Äôs all. But that‚Äôs beside the point. What I wanted
to tell you about ‚Äî and you are a poor receptacle ‚Äî is,
of course, the firm‚Äôs inevitable degradation. I have
kept you pining too long. First they petrified, and
then the stone began to rot away. The process must
of course have been very gradual. It was Anthony
Lispett who at the same time finished it off, and who
yet ‚Äî at least according to my notion of the thing,
though Henrietta does not agree ‚Äî and who yet re-
deemed the complete contraption.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe must have come into the firm when he was a
comparative youngster, say nineteen, towards the end
of the 1 8th century. Needless to say, not a single one
of the partners, not at least to my knowledge, ever
went to a university or any fallalery of that kind. They
held aloof from alien ideals. Their ‚Äòculture‚Äô was in
their history and in their blood ; and not a Methuse-
lah‚Äôs lifetime could exhaust even a fraction of that.
They had no ambitions ; did not mix ; kept to them-
selves. Their ladies made their own county society ‚Äî
sparrowhawk-nosed,sloping-shouldered,high-boned,
fair-haired beauties for the most part. It was an hon-
our to know them ; to be known by them ; a privilege
‚Äî and one arrogantly reserved, to be among their
‚Äòcustomers.‚Äô They were Lispet, Lispett and Vaine.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWell, this Anthony seems to have been something
of an exotic leaven. From the beginning, he was two-
thirds himself, p/us, if yo&rsquo;u Uke, three thirds a Lispett.
There is a portrait of him in his youth ‚Äî an efflorescent
Georgian dandy, whiskers, hauteur, eyebrows all com-</p>
<p>LISPET, LISPETT AND VAINE 189</p>
<p>plete ; a kind of antique Beau Brummel. No doubt
the old boys squinted askew at him out of their spec-
tacles, no doubt they nodded at each other about him
over their port. No doubt their good ladies pursed
their mouths at him over their teacups.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut they could no more resist the insidious growth
of the creature than Jack‚Äôs mother could have held
down the sprouting beanstalk. He was clearly the
fruit of breeding-in, and of a kind of passive vain-
gloriousness, as you will see when Henrietta exhibits
the Family Tree.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOld John Vaine Lispet Lispett had married his
first cousin Jemima Lispett, and Anthony, it seems,
was their only child. There is a story that old John
himself in his youth had ‚Äî well, gossip is merely gos-
sip,and gossamer‚Äôs merely gossamer, however prolific
it may be. And, whether or not, there is no doubt that
Anthony in his boyhood had made an attempt to run
away. They picked him up seven miles from the
coast ‚Äî ^half-starved and practically shoeless. He must
have.been off to Tyre or Damascus, or something of
that kind. One knows how one‚Äôs worm may turn.</p>
<p>. ‚ÄúPoor child ‚Äî just that one whiff of freedom, and he
was back once more, gluing his nose, beating his
fledgling plumes, against an upper window of the
house on the hiU. The whole thing, top to bottom,
was a kind of slavery, of course. The firm had its own
Factory Laws.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo ‚Äòhand‚Äô, for example was allowed to wear, at
least within sight of those windows, any fabric not of
the firm‚Äôs weaving. No hand ever came into direct
contact with one of the partners. There was a kind of</p>
<p>190 LISPET, LISPETT AND VAINE</p>
<p>hereditary overseer ‚Äî a family of the name of Watts.
Every hand, again, was strictly forbidden to starve.
If he or she misbecame himself or herself, instant dis-
missal followed ; and a generous pension.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo drastic was the relation between the valley-
village and the hill that for upwards of two hundred
and ^ty years, only one hand had so misbecome her-
self. She had smiled a little smile one Spring morning
out of her litde bottle-glass casement above her loom
at the middle-aged Vaine ; and she drew her pension
for six months ! They say she drowned herself in the
Marshes. It is as if you went and hanged yourself for
having too short a nose.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI cannot see the analogy,‚Äù said I.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Maunders, ‚Äúbut your Maker would ‚Äî
the Jehovah that blessed the race of the vulture that
sold me this old replica of a candlestick. Can‚Äôt you
understand that her smile was a natural thing (just
out of herself), and that he was a kind of sacrosanct
old Pharaoh? The discipline was abominable accord-
ing to our sentimental modern notions. But then, the
perquisites were pretty generous.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe long and the short of it was that every single
one of the firm‚Äôs employees was happy. They were
happy in the only sense one can be truly happy ‚Äî ^in
service. Corruptions have swarmed in now, but in the
old days the village in the valley must have been as
beautiful as a picture of this green old world hung
up in the forecourt of Paradise.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt had houses contemporary with every wing of
the Works on the lull-top. Its wages were for the
most part the only decent wages one can accept. They</p>
<p>LISPET, LISPETT AND VAINE 19I</p>
<p>were in Idnd. What, I ask you, in the sight of heaven
is the fittest payment to John Keats for a sonnet ‚Äî
a Thousand Guineas or a plume of your little Eliza-
beth‚Äôs golden fuzz ?</p>
<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to sentimentalize. J.K. had to live, I
suppose (though why, we may be at loggerheads to
explain). But what is porridge without cream, and
what is cream if you loathe the cow ? I ask you, my
dear K., is not a living wage simply one that will
keep the kind of life it represents fully alive ?</p>
<p>‚ÄúGive them the credit, then. L. L. and V. kept their
hands positively blossoming with life. I don‚Äôt mean
they theorized. Marx is merely the boUed-up senti-
ment of a civilisation gone wrong. They weren‚Äôt
philanthropists. Nor am I, please heaven. The quality
of the L. L. and V. merchandise ensured quality in
their hands. Where we walk now ‚Äî this macadamized
road ‚Äî was once a wood of birches and bluebells. Can
you even imagine its former phantom denizens to
have been knocked-kneed or under-hung ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúPerhaps not,‚Äù said I, ‚Äúbut are you intending to
imply that the ‚Äòphantom denizens,‚Äô as you call them,
manufacture the bluebells ?‚Äù</p>
<p>Maunders made an indescribably guttural noise in
his throat.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat I am saying,‚Äù he replied, ‚Äúis that the village
was as lovely a thing to see and live and laugh and
love and dream in as were the bodies of the human
beings that occupied it. Tke/r stock, too, had dimbed
from grace to grace. They enjoyed a recognizable
type of beauty. The girls were as fair-skinned as a
plucking of apricots, with hair of a spidery fine silk-</p>
<p>192 LISPET, LISPETT AND VAINE</p>
<p>enness, and eyes worthy of their veiling. JustNature‚Äôs
mimicry, I suppose ; like an Amazonian butterfly, or
the praying mantis or ‚Äî or the stick caterpillar.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI can see them ‚Äî and so could you, if you had the
eyes ‚Äî can see them dancing in the first of early
moonlight, or bathing in what, prior to the human
spawning of tin cans and old boots, was a stream
crystal as Pharpar. I can see them sallying out and re- &rsquo;
turning on their chattering to-and-fro in the morning
dews and the greying twilight. No set hours ; only a
day as long or as short as love of its task could make
it. What indeed is breeding, n.y dearK., but the show-
ing forth of a perfectly apt and peculiar excellency ?
Just fitness for its job. Puma, pelican, Patagonian
papalja, pretty Poll.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat is a papalja. Maunders ?‚Äù I inquired.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù said Maunders. ‚ÄúBut imagine
them ‚Äî ^with whatever effort is necessary ‚Äî ascending
and descending that hUl-side through their Fruit
Walk ! It is about the nearest approach to any earthly
vision I can achieve of Jacob‚Äôs ladder. Give even
your abominable old London a predominent L.L. &amp;
V. ‚Äî well, then, but not till then, you may invite me
to the Mansion House for its annual November 9th.
But there, I‚Äôm not an iconoclast.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI wish, Maunders,‚Äù said I, ‚Äúyou would at your
leisure re-read Unto this Last ; and that you would
first make the ghost of an attempt to tell ^ decent
story. What was the Fruit Walk ?‚Äù</p>
<p>The Town‚Äôs puddley, petrol-perfumed, outlying
streets were still busy witB pedestrians ‚Äî ^nurses and
perambulators, children in woollen gaiters, and young</p>
<p>LISPET, LISPETT AND VAINE 195</p>
<p>ladies with red hair. It was, therefore, almost as diffi-
cult to keep abreast with Maunders as it was to follow
his obscure meanderings.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOh, the Fruit Walk,‚Äù he muttered, staring vac-
antly through a dairyman‚Äôs window at an earthen-
ware green-and-grey pelican with a fish in its bill.
‚ÄúThe Fruit Walk was merely the cherries and quinces
and crab-apples and damsons that had been planted
in rosy, snowy, interlacing, discontinuous quincunx
fashion ; half circling and straggling over and down
the green mounting and mounded hiU to the very
edge of the quarry. Not a miserable avenue, of
course, but a kind of to-and-fro circuitous chace be-
tween village and Works. Once, your eyes might ac-
tually have seen that divine chimneyed cluster, tran-
quil as an image in water, on the dark emerald hill-
top in the dying, gaudy sunset. And, shelving down,
that walk in bloom ! One might almost assume that
L. L. &amp; V. weather habitually haunted the scene.
Things do react on one another, you know ; and
Nature wears 14th century sleeves.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúOh, for pity‚Äôs sake. Maunders, let‚Äôs get back to
Anthony. What about Anthony ?‚Äù</p>
<p>Maunders, softly striding along like an elephant in
his flat square-toed shoes, appeared to be pondering.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWell,‚Äù he began slowly,‚Äú the ‚Äòwhat-about‚Äô of
Anthony covers a rather wide field. I fancy, do you
know, there was a tinge of Traherne in his compos-
ition. The beau was only the chrysalis stage. Of course
it was Blake‚Äôs era. I fancy Anthony sowed pretty early
his wild oats. There are many varieties, and his were
mainly of the mind.‚Äù</p>
<p>194 1. ISPET, LISPETT AND VAINE</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe was not, I venture to add, to make things
quite dear to you,either a marrying or an un-marrying
man. And, of course, like all instinctive creatures with
a never-waning fountain of life in them, he shed.
Some of us shed feathers, some fur, some innocence,
some principles, and all shed skin ‚Äî the seven year‚Äôs
Spring-cleaning, you know, that leaves the house in
the flooding May-day sunlight a little bit dingier than
it was before.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWell, Anthony seems to have shed what one mis-
takes for artificialities. He shed his ringlets, his fop-
pish clothes, his pretences of languor, lus dreamy su-
periority. He shed his tacit acceptance of the firm‚Äôs
renown, and so discovered his own imagination.
Only in the ‚Äòtip-toppers‚Äô do intellect and imagination
lie down together, as will the lion and the lamb.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThen, of course, he seems gradually or suddenly
to have shed the L. L. &amp; V. pride and arrogance. He
must have begun to think. All these centuries, please
remember, the firm had been gradually reusing
why, actually their stuff -was super-excellent in
the eyes of humanity. And that ‚Äî Oh, I don‚Äôt know ;
but to realise that, perhaps, is to discount its merits
elsewhere. Anthony, on the other hand, had come to
realise, in his own queer vague fashion, that one‚Äôs only
salvation is to set such eyes squinting. And yet, not
of set and deliberate purpose. He was not a wit. Art,
my dear, dear K., whatever you may like to say, is
useless ; unless one has the gumption to dissociate
use from materialism.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI was not aware,‚Äù said I, ‚Äúthat I had said anything.
You mean, 1 suppose, that a man has only to realise</p>
<p>LISPET, tlSPETT AND VAINE I95</p>
<p>that his work is excellent for it to begin to lose its
virtue. Like beauty, Maunders, and the rouge-pot
and powder-puflF ? Still, I prefer Anthony to trade
ethics. What did the rest of them do ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat I was about to tell you,‚Äù replied Maunders
mildly, ‚Äúis, that Anthony had bats in his belfry. Not
the vampire variety ; just extra-t&amp;iiestti3\ bats. He
was ‚Äòqueer.‚Äô Perhaps more in him than in most of us
had come from elsewhere. And the older he grew the
more the hook- winged creatures multiplied. No doubt
the Firm would have edged him out if it had been
practicable. No doubt the young hedge-sparrows
would edge out the squab-cuckoo, if that were man -
ageable. But it was not. Anthony was double-dyed, a
Lispett with two t&rsquo;s, and it would have been Use ma-
jesHy domestic high-treason to acknowledge to the
world at large that he was even eccentric.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWell, there he was, a smallish man, with short-
growing hair, a little like Thothmes II., to judge
from his portrait ‚Äî a man of extraordinary gifts in his
craft, of an exquisite sensibility to quality and design,
but seldom, I imagine, at the Board Meetings. Often,
it seems, he used to ramble off into the country. He
appears to have especially hated a sort of Frenchi-
ness that had crept into the firms‚Äô wares. But much
worse than mooning about to soak in Englishness
again, he would ramble off into the country of his
mindy and there you need to have a faint notion of
where you are before you can safely go any further.
It‚Äôs difficult, of course, to know exactly what his
^l^roodings were. But the stoiy goes that he would
/comiplete his nocturnal pilgrimages by climbing up</p>
<p>196 LISPET, LISPETT AND VAINE</p>
<p>before daybreak into one of the fruit-trees on the hill,
a magnificent mulberry ‚Äî to see the sun, I suppose ;
to ‚Äòlook down‚Äô as far as possible on the Works ; to
be up among the morning birds, like the old man in
the limerick.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAn odd bat, that,‚Äù I interposed.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere he would squat,‚Äù continued Maunders im-
perturbably, ‚Äú poor old creature, peering out of the
leaves, the rose of dawn on his face, as when it
lightened Blake‚Äôs. And presently, the angels up from
the valley would pass by, singing and laughing, to
their work. A pretty sight ic mast have been, with
their young faces and pure colours and nimble prac-
tised gestures. For, mind you, it was still a happiness
to be one of the hands in the firm ‚Äî as compared, at
any rate, with being a grimy paw elsewhere. Only at
long last would they become aware of the glowing
gloom in the heads. Not merely were the brains of
the fiirm tending in one direction and the members
remaining more or less static in another, but things
outside were beginning to change. The god of
machinery was soon to spout smoke and steam from
his dismal nostrils, and man to learn the bright little
lesson that not only necessities, but even luxuries,
can be the cheaper if they are manufactured a gross
at a time.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said I ; ‚Äúthere he would squat ; and then ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThen,‚Äù breathed Maunders, ‚Äúone morning, one
shafted scarlet morning, it seems he saw ‚Äî ^well, I can-
not say what exactly he did see. No hand anyhow,
but a light-embodied dream. A being lovelier than
any goddess for whom even an L. L. &amp; V. in dw set-</p>
<p>LISPET, LISPETT AND VAINE 197</p>
<p>vice of the Sorceress of Sidon could have been moved
from bowels of superstitious horror to design sandals.
A shape, a fleetingness, a visitant ‚Äî poor old Bat-in-
the-Belfry ‚Äî -evoked by a moment‚Äôs aspiration and
delight out of his own sublime wool-gatherings. And
so this ageing creature, this extra-Lispetted old day-
dreamer, fell in love ‚Äî ^with a non-entity.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy dear Maunders ; pause,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIn mere self-
respect 1 How could such an occurrance as that have
been recorded in the Firm‚Äôs annals ? No ; no.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt there letters ?‚Äù sighed Maunders, turn-
ing suddenly on me, malacca cane in air. ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt
there a crack-brained diary? Haven‚Äôt you a vestige of
old-fashined and discredited gumption ? Wait till I
have finished, and let your sweet-smelling facts have
a show. Ask Henrietta. I say,‚Äù he repeated stubborn-
ly, ‚Äúthat between the dawn and the daytime, down
out of his broad foliage, the hill-side in indescribable
bloom, this old meandering Query, this half-demented
old Jack-o‚Äô-Dreams saw a Vision, and his heart went
the same way as long since had gone his head. Haven‚Äôt
I told you he was what the dear old evolutionists,
blind to the inexhaustible graces of creation, esteem
a sport ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Family Tree had blossomed out of season,
for the last time, jetting its dwindling virtue into this
final, queer, anomalous bloom ; rich with nectarous
bane. It had returned upon itself. ‚ÄôTis the last rose of
Summer that sighs of the Spring. ‚ÄòAh, yes, but did
the vision see him ?‚Äô ‚Äî you are sneering to yourself.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd to that I reply : I don‚Äôt know. Do they ever ?
Or is it that only certain long-suffering eyes can afford</p>
<p>198 LISPET, LISPETT AND VAINE</p>
<p>them the hospitality of becoming visible ? Anyhow,
I see her. And in a fashion that is not only the bliss
but the very deuce of solitude. Ignore its bidding, K.,
and we are damned. Oh yes, I know. The inward eye
is all very well. I know it. But to share that experience
with these outward groping orbs. I‚Äôd ‚Äî well. I‚Äôd
gladly go bankrupt. Ask Henrietta.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat happened then ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis happened. The wool-gathering wits flocked
back and golden-fleeced him. One might almost say
he became equally astute and extravagant. As a matter
of fact, of course, only willing and selfless service can
bring every human faculty to bear.‚Äù Maunders sighed.
‚ÄúHe sent a cheque for a thousand guineas or so to a
Dutch bulb-farm, and planted the hill- walk with tu-
lips, April-blue scyUas and narcissi ponici. Narcissi
poetici ! He tapped an earth-bound spring and set up
fauns and dryards, amoretti and what not, spouting
subterranean water. He built a shrine of alabaster ‚Äî
with an empty niche.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt appeared to be mere scatter-brained fooling.
Still, it was in a sense in the L. L. &amp; V. tradition, and
his partners appear to have let him have a free hand.
Don‚Äôt forget their even then almost illimitable re-
sources. They‚Äôd far far rather ‚Äî even the strict-whis-
kered Vaine of the period, who in unhappier circum-
stances might have sat for the typical alderman ‚Äî
they‚Äôd infinitely rather he exhibited his peculiarities
within their sphere, so to speak, than bring them to
mockery before the world at large.‚Äù</p>
<p>1 see.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey hadn‚Äôt till then perhaps baldly recognised</p>
<p>LISPET, I. ISPETT AND VAINE IQ9</p>
<p>the world at large, except as a hot-bed of prehistoric
or sycophantic customers. And they never ‚Äî not for
an instant ‚Äî even surmised his depredations would
prove active from mthin. None the less, like some
secret serpent, spawn of the forgotten fabulous, he
was in fact gnawing at the very vitals of the tradition.
I.¬´t me put it bluntly, in terms which even you, my
I dear K., will appreciate. Anthony Lispett had ‚Äògone
balmy‚Äô on his Vision. She ‚Äî and therefore he‚Äî was
‚Äòbeside himself&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not suggest that be mixed her up with his
superannuating old corpus vile ; nothing vulgar to talk
of, and tragic to think of, in that sort. He merely
lived on from that daybreak dream to dream with
but one desire in his poor cracked old cranium ‚Äî to
serve her idea. Aren‚Äôt we, all of us, myth-makers ?
Grins not the Lion at the Unicorn ? Does not the
soapboiler bedizen our streets with Art ‚Äî and ‚Äòatmos-
phere‚Äô ? Anthony‚Äôs myth was from elsewhere ‚Äî nei-
ther from his stomach, his pocket, his reputation, his
utilitarian morals, nor his brains. That was all. And
as he served her, I suppose, he found himself cheru-
I bically treading yet more secretly and inwardly her
hesperidean meads.‚Äù</p>
<p>I glanced at Maunders in some dismay. ‚ÄúHow ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWell,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúit is not easy to divine how ex-
actly Anthony began his malpractices. But clearly,
since he was perpetually haunted by this illusion of a
divine, unearthly stranger, a sort of Athene haunting
his hill, his one desire could not but be to set the
Works working for her. He could bide his time. He
could be quiet and gradual. Anyhow, we know the</p>
<p>200 LISPET, LISPETT ANB VAINE</p>
<p>event, though we can‚Äôt say precisely how it evolved.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOne may assume, I suppose, that he would steal j
to and fro among the nocturnal looms and presses
and vats and dyeing rooms, and, ten times more;
richly gifted by his insane inspiration than he was
even by nature, that he just doctored right and left.
He would experiment night after night with the firm‚Äôs
materials in the raw. Worse, he rationed himself in his
tree-gazing ; and climbed to his leafy perch only dur-
ing certain conjunctions of the planets. Mere circum-
stances seem to have waited on him, as did the sun on
Joshua.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut the Lispet and the Vaine of this time were
nothing but hidebound old bachelors ‚Äî intent only
on saving the face of convention. The last Double-T
died the day after the site of the shrine was decided
on. There was no young blood in the firm. And with
an almost diabolical ingenuity Anthony seems to have
executed only the orders of such clients as wanted
the firm‚Äôs very finest and rarest handiwork. Even
those, of course, who coveted or could afford only
the commoner materials were already beginning to
dwindle in numbers.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe other customers he kept waiting, or insulted
with questions, or supplied with more delicate and
exquisite fabrics than they required.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe story goes that a certain Empress renowned
for her domestic virtues commanded a trousseau for
yet another royal niece or what not. A day or two be-

<p>silk, such as only a nymph could wear. My dear K.,
it nearly hatched a European War, That particular
Court was little but a menagerie of satyrs,</p>
<p>‚ÄúCountesses and such-Hke soliciting ‚Äòfives‚Äô and
‚Äòfours‚Äô in gloves, and ‚Äòones‚Äô in stockings, might still
faintly hope to be accommodated; and even then their
coveted wares were a tight fit. For a while the firm
seems to have survived on the proceeds from mer-
chandise intended for grown-ups which your cos-
mopolitan Croesuses snapped up for their children.
At second-hand, of course, since few of them could
extort a ‚Äòreference‚Äô to the firm for love or even for
money.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHenrietta has a few bits of embroideries and silk
of the time. Perhaps she will show them to you. Even
a human craft can reflect a divine disaster. And the
linens ! ‚Äî of a quality that would derange the ghost
of an Egyptian embalmer.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEven worse, Anthony seems to have indulged an
extraordinary sense of propriety. He would lavish
L. L. &amp; V. urbanities on some sylph of an actress
who had no more morals in the usual acceptation of
the term than a humming bird, and flatly returned
fabulous cheques (with the order) to old proteges of
the firm merely convicted of fortune-making, or of
organised ‚Äòphilanthropy‚Äô, or of ‚Äòbettering the con-
ditions‚Äô of their fcllow-crcatures. He seems to have
hated the virtuous for their own sake alone.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn short, he grew madder and madder, and the
custom, the good-will, even the reputation of the
firm melted like butter in the sun. The last;^Lispet
followed the last Double-T ‚Äî expired of apoplexy in</p>
<p>202 LISPET, LISPETT AND VAINE</p>
<p>the counting-house, and was sat on by the coroner,
The reigning Vaine turned religious and was buried
in a sarcophagus of Portland stone under the foun-
dations of the Unitarian Chapel which he himself had
laid in the hope perhaps to lay the L. L . &amp; V. devil at
the same time.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe hands dwindled, died out, dropped away, or
even emigrated to the paws. Only a few with some
little competence and an impulsive fund of gratitude
and courtesy worked on for a master of whom be-
cause they loved him, they asked the paltriest
wages. The Fruit Walk rrutined into a thicket ; the
fountains choked themselveswith sighing and greened
with moss ; the tulips found a quieter Nirvana in
mere leaf. And Anthony made at last no pretenc^
even of patronising the final perishing flower of the*
firm‚Äôs old clientele. j</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe trafficked in a kind of ludicrous dolls‚Äô mer-
chandi2e ‚Äî utterly beautiful litde infinitesimals in fab-
rics worth a hundred times their weight in rubies.
So ridiculous a scandal had the ‚Äòbusiness‚Äô at last be-
come that when its few scoffing creditors for old sake‚Äôs
sake sold it up, not a single bid was made for the pro-
perty. It is in ruins now. Consult Ezekiel. Or Hen-
rietta.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI have no wish to sentimentalize ; I am not a cjmiq
or a philosopher. Yet I slide my eyes back to that nar-i
row hilled-in strip of sea-coast whence once rosc^
walled Tyre and Sidon, Arvard and Jebail, and ‚Äî
well, I merely remind myself that the Rosetta Stone
is but a hornbook of the day before yesterday‚Äôs chil-
dren of men. Things as a matter of fact seem to rot</p>
<p>LISPET, LISPETT AND VAINE 203</p>
<p>of their own virtue ‚Äî ^inverted, so to speak. It‚Äôs not
likely to occur again. I mean, not for some time. The
Town was almost apologetic. Democracy rarely runs
to extremes ‚Äî unless one may so describe the guillo-
tine. But I am no politician. Enough of that. Even
transatlantic visitors are now rare.‚Äù</p>
<p>Maunders and I were standing together by this
time under the laurels and bay-trees, not of his own
planting, besides his garden raihngs ; he with his
bulging, pale-blue eyes ‚Äî and his sham candlestick
branching out of his pocket ; and I ‚Äî well, irritated
beyond endurance.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGood heavens, Maunders,‚Äù I exclaimed, ‚Äúthe
stuff you talk ! But one would not mind that so much
if you could spin a decent yarn. You haven‚Äôt even
told me what became of the Belfry. Was he nothing
but bats at last ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúOld Anthony ?‚Äùhe murmured softly. ‚ÄúWhy, there
is nothing in that. He lived on ‚Äî for years ‚Äî in the
Works. You could see his burning candle from the
valley, even on nights of full moon. And, of course,
some gay imbecile set the story about that the whole
lovely abandoned derelict place was haunted. Twang-
ling strings and vanishing faces, and a musing shape
at a remoter window, her eyes reflecting a scene
which only an imagination absolutely denuded of
commonsense could hope or desire to share with her.
After aU, one does ignore the ghost until it is well out
of the body. Ask Henrietta.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut, Mavmders,‚Äù I called after him.</p>
<p>Too late : his shapeless slouching slate-grey body
with its indescribable hat and malacca cane had</p>
<p>204 LISPET, LISPETT AND VAINE</p>
<p>vanished among the ‚Äòevergreens‚Äô, and the only
answer I received was the dwindling rumour of
my own expostulatory voice among their leaves ‚Äî
‚ÄúMaunders &hellip;‚Äù</p>
<p>Strange to say, it was in this moment of helpless-
ness that I discovered that my little bast basket was!
gone. When? How? For an instant I hesitated‚Äî in pure
cowardice. It was a quarter past one, and Mrs. Maun-
ders, a charming and active hostess, if a little of a
martinet, disapproved of unpunctual guests. But only
for an instant. The thought of Bettie‚Äôs fair glad little
face decided me ; and I set out to retrace my foot-
steps in search of the lost plaything. Alas, in vain.</p>
<p>THE TREE</p>
<p>E ncased in his dingy first-dasS railway carriage,
the prosperous Fruit Merchant sat alone. From
the collar of his thick frieze greatcoat stuck out a
triangular nose. On either side of it a small, bleak,
black eye gazed absently at one of the buttons on the
empty blue-upholstered seat opposite to him. His
breath spread a fading vapour in the air. He sat
bolt upright, congealed in body, heated in mind, his
unseeing eye fixed on that cloth button, that stud.</p>
<p>There was nothing else to look at, for his six narrow
glass windows were whitely sheeted with hoar-frost.
Only his thoughts were his company, while the coach,
the superannuated coach, bumped duUy on over the
metals. And his thoughts were neither a satisfaction
nor a pleasure. His square hard head under his
square hard hat was nothing but a pot seething wdth
vexation, scorn, and discontent.</p>
<p>What had invited him out so far, in weather so
dismal, on a line so feebly patronised ? Anger all
but sparkled in his mind as he considered the intention
of his journey, and what was likely to be the end and
outcome of it. Twelve solid yet fleeting years
divided him from his last encounter with his half-
brother ‚Äî twelve cent, per cent, years ‚Äî shipload on
shipload of exotic oranges and lemons, pineapples,
figs, and blushing pomegranates. At this very
moment three more or less seaworthy ocean tramps
were steaming across the watery channels of the
world laden with cargoes of which he was the
principal consignee. He stretched out his legs.</p>
<p>THE TREE</p>
<p>206</p>
<p>crossed his feet. He was a substantial man. There
was nothing fantastic about him.</p>
<p>To put on airs when you couldn‚Äôt afford them ;
to meet a friendly offer with rank ingratitude ; to
quarrel with the only relative on earth who had kept
you out of the workhouse ‚Äî ^he had sworn never to
set foot in the place again. Yet ‚Äî ^here he was : and
nothing but a fool for his pains. Having washed his
hands of the whole silly business, he should have kept
them washed. Instead of whicli he thrust them
deeper into his capacious pockets and wondered to
heaven when his journey ‚Äôvas to come to an end.</p>
<p>No, it was with no charitable, no friendly, no
sentimental motive that he was being glided joltingly
on. A half-brother ‚Äî and particularly if he owes you
a hundred pounds and more ‚Äî need not be even
fractionally a being one smiles to think of for the sake
of auld lang syne. There was nothing in common
between the two of them, except a father now twenty-
five years in his grave and a loan that would never be
repaid.</p>
<p>That was one galling feature of the situation.
There was another. In plain print and in his own
respectable morning newspaper the Fruit Merchant
had chanced but a week or two ago on the prepos-
terous fact that a mere woodcut of a mere ‚ÄúBird and
Flower,‚Äù initialled P. P., had fetched at Christie‚Äôs
ninety-seven guineas. Ninety-seven guineas : sixty-
eight crates of excellent Denia oranges at thirty
shillings a crate. What the devil ! His small eyes
seemed to congest and yet at the same time to
protrude from their sockets.</p>
<p>THE TREE</p>
<p>207</p>
<p>‚ÄúP. P.‚Äù !‚Äî perfect pest ; paltry poser ; pla^ey
parasite. And yet ‚Äî hardly a parasite. You couldn‚Äôt
with a term like that dish a half-brother who hadn‚Äôt
sent you a single word of greeting for twelve solid
fleeting prosperous years. Even if he did owe you a
hundred pounds. Even if he hadn‚Äôt the faintest wish
to remind you of the fact. Not that the Fruit
Merchant wanted his hundred pounds. He wasn‚Äôt
a debt collector. He wasn‚Äôt even vindictive. It was
the principle of the thing.</p>
<p>For if half-an-hour‚Äôs silly scratching over a little
lump of wood could fetch you ;Cioi 17s., about
twenty-nine- and a half minutes would bring in a
round hundred. And there were more birds and
more flowers in that infernal tree than Noah could
have found room for in his Ark. The tree ! ‚Äî ^the
very thought of it swept a pulsating cloud of rage over
the Fruit Merchant‚Äôs eyes. Cool, quiet insolence ‚Äî he
could have forgiven that, and could almost have
forgotten it. But the faintest recollection of the
tree, and of the talk under it, never failed to infuriate
him. It infuriated him now almost beyond endur-
ance, simply because he knew, in the secrecy of his
thoughts, that this was the decoy which was dragging
him on these fifty-three interminable miles on a
freezing hideous country afternoon.</p>
<p>The tree : never in all his life had he met with such
an exhibition of sheer, stark, midsummer madness.
And yet with every inch of his journey the recollection
grew on him. He couldn‚Äôt get it out of his head.
Curiosity, resentment, vindictiveness, a cold creeping
cunning ‚Äî a score of confficting emotions zigzagged</p>
<p>THE TREE</p>
<p>208</p>
<p>to and fro in his mind. He gkred through them at
the walls of his cage. But worst outrage of all was ,
die creeping realisation ‚Äî and his body stiffened at &rsquo;
the thought ‚Äî that he was even now, and perhaps even ^
a litde more than ever, afraid of the tree. When you,
finally deal with a relative and a bloodsucker who has)
been a pest to you all your life, the one thing you do&rsquo;
not look for is an interference of that kind.</p>
<p>He could not deny it, the tree had impressed him.
Ever since that first swimming stare at it, the moment
he thought of his brother, of the country, even of his
boyhood ‚Äî there it was. It had impressed him so
much that the upholstered button had now completely
disappeared, and he seemed to be actually in the
presence of it again. He saw it as vividly as if its
image hung there before his very eyes in the slightly
self-warmed air of his solitary compartment. The
experience filled him with so sudden a flood of
aversion and resentment that the voice of the guard
chaunting the name of his destination reached him
only just in time to set him frantically pulling down
his frozen window and ejecting himself out of the
train.</p>
<p>One hasty glance aroimd him showed that he was
the sole traveUer to alight on the frosted timbers of
the obscure little station. A faint rosiness in the wesf
foretold the decline of the stiU wintry day. The firs
that flanked the dreary passenger-shed of the plat-
form stood burdened already with the blackness of
coming night.</p>
<p>He was elderly, he was obese, his heart was none
too sound, at least as compared with his head. Yet if</p>
<p>THE TREE</p>
<p>209</p>
<p>he intended to catch the last ttain home, he had
scarcely a couple of hours in which to reach his half-
brother‚Äôs wretched little house, to congratulate him
on his guineas, to refuse to accept repayment of his
loan, to sneer at his tree, and to return to the station.</p>
<p>A bark at a weedy young porter in mittens, with
mouth ajar over his long teeth, sent him ambling off
for a conveyance. The Fruit Merchant stood under
the shed in his frieze coat and square hard hat and
watched the train glide out of the station. The
screech of its engine, horning up into the windless
air, had exactly expressed his own peculiar sentiments.</p>
<p>There was not a living being in sight whereon to
breathe a curse. Only himself, a self he had been
vaguely cursing throughout his tedious journey.
The frozen landscape lay white in the dying day.
The sun hung like the yolk of an egg above the stiU
horizon. Some menace in the very look of this suUen
object hinted that P. P. might long since have crossed
the bourne from which no bekted draft on any
earthly bank had ever been known to transpire.</p>
<p>The thought diverted into ruggeder channels the
current of the talk which he had intended to engage
in with his half-brother. In other words, he would
give the siUy fool a bit of his mind. The fact was,
their last quarrel ‚Äî if anything so one-sided could be
called a quarrel ‚Äî had tinctured the Fruit Merchant‚Äôs
outlook on the world a good deal more densely than
he would until now have confessed. A frown settled
above the sullen eyes.</p>
<p>No living creature, no sound stirred the air. The
fair country ky cold as if in a swoon. Like a shallow</p>
<p>210</p>
<p>THE TREE</p>
<p>inverted saucer a becalmed sky curved itself over the
unbroken quiet of the fields. His broad cleft chin
thrust into his muffler, his hands into his capacious^
pockets, the stranger to these parts stood waiting, justi
stood there, with his small black eyes staring deso-
lately out of his clothes. Why, you might just as well
be marooned in a foreign land, or on a stage ‚Äî sinister,
cold, vacant, and not a single soul in the audience. At
the sound of wheels and hoofs he coughed as if in
uncontrollable indignation ; and turned smartly on
his heels. . . .</p>
<p>With a gesture of disdain the Fruit Merchant sourly
thrust a shiUing into the weedy porter‚Äôs immemiy
knuckled hand and mounted into the cab. At his&rsquo;.
onset the whole square fusty interior leaned towards
him like an extinguisher over the stub of a candle.
The vehicle disgraced the universe. Even the man
on the box resembled some little cautious and obscure
animal that had been dug up out of the earth. When
given his direction his face had fallen into an
indescribable expression beneath its whiskers : an
expression, it appeared, which was its nearest
approach to a smfie.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt spare your ‚Äî ahorse,‚Äù had barked his
fare, slamming the rickety door behind him.</p>
<p>A railway carriage even of the most antique
description, when its glass is opaque with rime, is a
little less like a prison cell than a four-wheeled cab.
For which reason, perhaps, as the vehicle ^roimd on
beneath the misty leafless elms, the frigid air was
allowed to beat softly in from the open window upon
its occupant‚Äôs slightly impurpled face.</p>
<p>THE TREE</p>
<p>2II</p>
<p>And Still on and on, now here, now there, memory
retrieved for the sombre shape within it every incident
of his last experience on this self-same road. It had
been summertime ‚Äî ^June. He had been twelve years
younger, a good gross of years less prosperous, and
not perhaps quite so easily fanned into a peculiar
helpless state of rage.</p>
<p>Indeed, his actual meeting with his half-brother at
the little wl: ite garden gate had been almost friendly.
So friendly tnat it would hardly have been supposed
they were in any way unpleasingly related to one
another, or that the least responsibility of each to each
could have caused any kind of festering recrimination.
Not that P. P. was even then the kind of person one
hastens to introduce to one‚Äôs friends. You not
only never knew how he would look or what he
would say. You weren‚Äôt even certain what he
might do. A rolling stone that merely fails to
gadier moss is a harmless object by comparison
with one that appears to gather momentum. And
even the most trifling suggestion, not so much of
eccentricity as of an alien and crooked gleam in
the eye, is apt to make the most respectable company
a little uneasy.</p>
<p>Not that the two half-brothers had ever discussed
together their aims and intentions and ideas about
life ; their desires or motives or hopes, or aversions
or apprehensions or prejudices. The Fruit Merchant
had his fair share of most of these human incentives,
but he also had principles, and one of them was to
keep his mouth shut.</p>
<p>They had met, had shaken hands, had exchanged</p>
<p>ZI2</p>
<p>THE TREE</p>
<p>remarks on the weather. Then P. P., in his frayed
jacket and slippers, with his meagre expressionless
face, had aimlessly led off his visitor into the garden,
had aimlessly dropped a few distant remarks about
their common past; and then, surrounded as they
were by the scenery, scents, and noises of summer, hadl
pushed his knotted hands into his trousers pockets,
and fallen silent ; his grey, vacant eyes fixed on the
tree. The Fruit Merchant had tried in vain to break
the silence, to shrug his way out of it. He also could
only stand and stare up and uo ‚Äî at the tree.</p>
<p>Solitary, unchallenged, exotic in its station all but
at the foot of the broken-hedged, straggling garden,
it rose to heaven, a prodigious spreamng ascendant
cone, with its long, dark, green, pointed leaves. It
stood, from first springing branch to apex, a motion-
less and somnolent fountain of flowers.</p>
<p>If his half-brother had taken the Fruit Merchant
into a dingy litde greenhouse and had shown him an
ailing plant that with care, water, and guano had been
raised from some far-fetched seed ‚Äî well, that might
have been something to boast about. He himself was
in the trade. He Imew a Jaffa orange from a man-
darin. The stuff has to grow, of course ; and he waS|
broad-minded enough to approve of rural enterprise
Giant Mangolds and Prize Pumpkins ‚Äî they did n(^
harm. They encouraged the human vegetable. But
the &hellip; .</p>
<p>At last he had come to his senses and had peered
fretfully about him. The garden was a waste, the
hedges untrimmed, a rank lusty growth of weeds
flaunted their&rdquo; flowers at the sun. And this tree^</p>
<p>THE TREE</p>
<p>213</p>
<p>it must have been flourishing here for centuries past,
a positive eyesore to any practical gardener. P. P.
couldn‚Äôt even put a name to it. Yet by the fixed
idiotic dreamy look on his face you might have
supposed it was a gift from heaven ; that, having
waved his hands about like those coloured humbugs
with the mango, the thing had sprung up by sheer
nragic out of the ground.</p>
<p>Not that the Fruit Merchant had denied that it
was unique. He had never seen, nor would he ever
want to see, its double. The sun had beaten down
upon his head ; a low, enormous drone filled the
air ; the reflected light dazed his eyes. A momentary
faintness had stolen over him as he had turned once
more and glanced again into his half-brother‚Äôs long
bony face ‚Äî the absent eyes, the prominent cheek, the
greying hair dappled with sunlight.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHow do you know it‚Äôs unique?‚Äù he had asked.
‚ÄúIt may be as common as blackberries in other parts
of the country‚Äî or abroad. One of the officers on
the Catamaran was telling me . . .</p>
<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù his half-brother had interrupted
him, ‚Äúbut I have been looking at trees all my life.
This resembles all, reminds me of none. Besides, I‚Äôm
not going abroad ‚Äî at least for the present.‚Äù</p>
<p>&ldquo;What had he meant by that ? The Fruit Merchant
hadn‚Äôt inquired ; had merely stood there in the flowers
and grasses, blinking up once more into the spreading
branches, almost involuntarily shaking his head at the
pungent sweetness that hung dense and sickly in
ific air. And the old familiar symptoms began to stir
in him, as he now sat jolting on in his cab ‚Äî symptoms</p>
<p>214 THE TREE</p>
<p>which his intimates would have described in one
word: fuming.</p>
<p>He was not denying it, not he ‚Äî the tree had been
remarkable as trees go. For one thing, it bore two
distinct kinds and shapes of blossom. The one
circular and full and milky in a dark cuplike calyx,
with clusters of scarlet-tipped pistils ; the other a pale
yellow oval, three-petalled, with a central splash of
orange. He had surreptitiously squeezed a couple
of the fallen flowers into his pocket-book, had taken
them out at his office in the Borough the next
morning to show them to die partner he had after-
wards advantageously bought out of the business,
only to find them black, slimy, and unrecognisable,
and to be laughed at for his pains.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the use of the thing?‚Äù he had next
inquired of his half-brother in a gross voice. ‚ÄúIs it
edible ?‚Äù At which, with the faint smile on his face
that had infuriated the Fruit Merchant even as a boy,
the other had merely shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy not try it on die pigs ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt keep pigs.‚Äù</p>
<p>Keep pigs, indeed ; there wasn‚Äôt the faintest
symptom that he would ever be able to keep himself I</p>
<p>‚ÄúWell, aren‚Äôt there any birds in these parts?‚Äù
It had been a singularly false move.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt has brought its own,‚Äù had been his half-
brother‚Äôs muttered retort.</p>
<p>There was no denying it ‚Äî at least so far as the
Fruit Merchant‚Äôs small ornithological knowledw
went. At that very moment birds of a peculiady
vivid green sheeniness were hovering and dipping</p>
<p>THE TREE</p>
<p>215</p>
<p>between the deep blue of the sky and the mountainous
blossoming. Little birds, widi unusually long and
attenuated bills, playing, fluttering, lisping, courting,
and apparently sucking the heady nectar from the
snowy and ivory cups, while poised like animate
gems on the wing. He had again opened his mouth,
but his half-brother had laid a lean tingling hand on
his sleeve. ‚ÄúListen !‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Half-stifled, jetting, delirious bursts of song
twinkled, belled, rose, eddied, overflowed from the
tented depths of the tree, like the yells and laughter
of a playground of children suddenly released for an
unexpected half-holiday. Listen, indeed ! The noise
of the creatures was still echoing in his ears as he sat
there bulkily swaying, his eyes fixed on the pallid,
gliding hedgerow from his fusty cab.</p>
<p>P. P. had not positively claimed that every single
chorister in the chorus was an exotic visitant. He had
gone further. He had gently bent down a low-
lying fan of leaves and bloom, and not content with
exhibiting one by one living specimens of a little
spotted blue iridescent beetle, a horned kind of cock-
chafer, and a dappled black-and-yellow-mottled
ladybird ‚Äî all of them following their lives in these
surroimdings ; he had also waved a lean hand in the
direction of a couple of gaudy butterflies intertwining
in flight down the slope of the garden, had pointed out
little clumps of saffron and sky-blue flowers, and a
rank, ungainly weed with a cluster of black helmet-
shaped florets at its tips, asserting that they were as
rare ‚Äî as unprecedented ‚Äî in those parts as the tree
itself.</p>
<p>THE TREE</p>
<p>216</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt mean to say because the thing‚Äôs brought
its own vermin that it‚Äôs any the better for that?
Lord, we can do that in the fruit trade.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs brought me,‚Äù said the other, mooning mean-
while in the opposite direction,</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd where do you raise your pertatoes and arti-
chokes and scarlet runners? It looks to me like a
dam waste of soil.‚Äù</p>
<p>The wandering greenish-grey eyes had rested for a
moment on the puffy contemptuous face a few inches
beneath them without the faintest symptom of intelli-
gence. Empty eyes, yet with a hint of danger in
them, like a bright green pool of water in a derelict
quarry. ‚ÄúYou shall have a basket of the fruit ; if
you‚Äôll risk it. It never really ripens ‚Äî queer-looking
seeds.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou eat it yourself, then ?‚Äù</p>
<p>The eyes slid away, the narrow shoulders had
lifted a little. ‚ÄúI take things as they come.‚Äù It was
precisely how he had afterwards taken the cheque.</p>
<p>Seated there, on either side of the deal table, in the
bare, imcarpeted, uncurtained living-room of the
cottage over a luncheon of bread and dry cheese and
onions, with the reflected light of the tree on his half-
brother‚Äôs face, the talk between the two of them had
gradually degenerated into an altercation.</p>
<p>At length the Fruit Merchant, with some little
relief, had completely lost his temper. A half empty
jam-pot buzzing with bees was no more appetising an
object because the insects were not of the usual variety.
He had literally been stung into repeating a few semi-
ffaternal truths.</p>
<p>THE TREE</p>
<p>217</p>
<p>To submit to being half-starved simply because
nobody with money to waste would so much as look
at your bits of drawings ; to sit there dreamily grin-
ning at a tree in your back-garden, twenty times more
usekss because there wasn‚Äôt its like for miles around,
even if there wasn‚Äôt ; to be content to hang like a
bloodsucker on the generosity of a relative half-blood
and half-water ‚Äî well, he had given P. P. a bit of his
mind.</p>
<p>The Fruit Merchant instinctively drew a cold fat
hand down his face as a more and more precise
recollection of the subsequent scene recurred to him.
Mere silence can be insulting, and there was one thing
about his half-brother ‚Äî worse than all the rest of his
peculiarities put together ‚Äî ^that had never failed to
reduce him to a feverish helplessness : his eyes. They
didn‚Äôt see you even when they were fixed on you
across a couple of feet of deal board. They saw
something else ; and with no vestige of common
courtesy.</p>
<p>And those hands ‚Äî you could swear at a glance that
they had never done a single honest day‚Äôs work in
their owner‚Äôs lifetime. Every sight of them had made
it easier for the Fruit Merchant to work himself up
into a blind refreshing rage. The cottage had fairly
shaken to his abuse. The raw onions had danced
under his fist on the table. And twining in and out
between his roarings and shoutings had meandered on
that other low, groping, dispassionate voice ‚Äî his
brother‚Äôs,</p>
<p>He had found his own place ; and there he intended
to remain. Rather than sit on a stool in a counting-</p>
<p>THE TREE</p>
<p>218</p>
<p>house writing invoices for crates of oranges and
pineapples he would hang himself from the topmost
branches of the tree. You had your own life to lead,
and it didn‚Äôt matter if you died of it. He was not
making any claims. There was nothing the same in
this world for any two individuals. And the more
different everything was, the more closely you should
cling to the difference.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, he had gone on, it was mere chance, or
whatever you liked to call it, that had brought him
here ; a mere chance that the tree had not even been
charged for in the rent, iheie it was, and it would
last him his lifetime ; and, when that was over, he
wouldn‚Äôt complain. He had wagged his skimpy beard,
a pencil between his fingers. No, he wouldn‚Äôt com-
ply if drey just dug a hole in the garden and shovelled
his body in under the grass within reach of the root-
lets, What‚Äôs your body ? ‚Äî ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll buy me aU right
when I‚Äôm safely dead. Try it ‚Äî ^it‚Äôs a fair speculation.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúTry what ?‚Äù The Fruit Merchant‚Äôs countenance
had suddenly set like a gargoyle in cast-iron.</p>
<p>His half-brother had nodded towards a dingy port-
folio that stood leaning against a half-empty bookcase.
And at that bis guest had laid about him with a will.
‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs the kind of profit you are hoping to make
out of your blighted old bee-bush? That‚Äôs your
profit? Thafs your fine airs ‚Äî ^your miserable scrib-
blings and scragglings.‚Äù</p>
<p>He had once more slammed down his fat fist on
the table and delivered his ultinaatum, ‚ÄúSee here, I
give you a hundred pounds, here and now. There‚Äôs
no claim on me, not a shred. We don‚Äôt even share</p>
<p>THE TREE</p>
<p>219</p>
<p>the same mother, even if we share the same dad. You
talk this abject rubbish to me. You have never
earned a decent penny in your life. You never will.
You ate a fool and a loafer. Go to the Parish ; and
go for good. I‚Äôm sick of it, d‚Äôye hear ? ‚Äî sick of it.
You sit there, whiffling that I haven‚Äôt eyes in my head,
that I don‚Äôt know black from white, that you‚Äôd rather
hang your miserable carcase in your wretched old
tree than take a respectable job. Well, hang it there
‚Äî it won‚Äôt break the branches if this is the only kind of
meal you can give a visitor ! I‚Äôm done with you. I
wash my hands of you. Do you hear ?‚Äù</p>
<p>He had ‚Äî ^inaccurately ‚Äî ^pantomimed the operation,
sweeping over the jampot as he did so, and now drew
in his breath ‚Äî a cold breath, too ; as, with eyes fixed
on the ever-lightening hedgerows beyond his oblong
window, he remembered the renewed red-hot stab of
pain that had transfixed the ball of his thumb.</p>
<p>It recalled him instantaneously to his surroundings.
Scrambling up from his seat he ejected his head out of
the cab into the open. ‚ÄúWhoa, there ! Whoa, I say :
I‚Äôm getting out.‚Äù</p>
<p>The horse was dragged up on to its haunches, the
cab came to a standstill, and, to the roaring suspira-
tions of the animal, the Fruit Merchant alighted on the
tinkling ice of a frozen wayside puddle of water. He
turned himself about. Time and the night had not
tarried during his journey. The east was a blaze of
moonlight. The moon glared in the grey heavens
like a circular flat little window of glass.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWait here ‚Äî ‚Äù the Fruit Merchant bade his cabman
in the desolation. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve pretty near shaken the
head off my body.‚Äù</p>
<p>THE TREE</p>
<p>,220</p>
<p>The cabman ducked his own small head in reply,
and saluted his fare with a jerk of his whip. ‚ÄúYou
won‚Äôt be long,‚Äù he sang out between his whiskers.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat did he mean by that?‚Äù was the Fruit Mer-
chant‚Äôs querulous question to himself as me mounted
the few remaining yards of by-lane towards the crest
of the slope. Fie was tired and elderly and cold. A
pathetic look, one almost of sadness, came into his
face. He pushed up his muffler and coughed. There
replied the faintest echo from the low copse that
bordered the lane. Grass, crystalled with hoarfrost,
muffled his footsteps. What had he meant by that ?
repeated self to self, but not as if expectant of an
answer.</p>
<p>When well out of sight of the cabman and hi|
vehicle beneath the slope of the hill, the Fruit Merl
chant paused and lifted his eyes. League beyonJ
league beneath him, as if to the confines of the worldl
the countryside spread on ‚Äî frost-beclad meadow,
wood and winding lane. And one sole house its
sight, a small, tumbledown, lightless, huddling
cottage, its ragged thatch and walls chequered black
with shadow and dazzling white with wash of
moonshine. And there ‚Äî lifting itself into the empty
skies, its twigs and branches sweeping the stars,
stood, as if in wait for him, the single naked
gigantic tree.</p>
<p>The Fruit Merchant gazed across at it, like an obese
min ute Belial on the ramparts of Eden. He had been
fooled, then; tricked. He might have guessed the
fatuity of his enterprise. He bad guessed it. The</p>
<p>THE TREE</p>
<p>221</p>
<p>house was empty ; the bird had flown. Why for a
single instant had he dreamed otherwise ? Simply
because all these years he had been deceived into
believing there was a kind of honesty in the fellow.
Just that something quixotic, stupid, stubborn,
dense, dull, demented which ‚Äî nothing but lies, then.</p>
<p>That bee in his bonnet, that snake in his grass :
nothing but lies. There was no principle by which
you could judge a man like that ; and yet ‚Äî well, after
all, he was like anybody else. Give him a taste of the
sweets of success, and his boosted solitude, his con-
tempt for the mere decencies of life, his pretended
disgust at men more capable and square-headed
than himself had vanished into thin air. There were
fools in the world, he had now discovered, who would
pay ninety-seven guineas for a second or third hand
scrabble of a drawing. ‚ÄúRight you are ; hand over
the dibs, and I am off !‚Äù</p>
<p>A scornful yet lugubrious smile stole over the
Fruit Merchant‚Äôs purplish features. He would be
honest about it ; he positively enjoyed acknow-
ledging when a rival had bested him over a bargain.
He would even agree that he had always nursed his
own litde superstitions. And now all that fine silly
talk ‚Äî sheer fudge. He had been himself childish
fool enough to be impressed by it ; yes, and to have
been even a little frightened by ‚Äî a tree.</p>
<p>He eyed it there‚Äî that gaunt, prodigious weed ;
and then, with one furtive glance over his round
shoulder towards the crest of the slope behind which
ky his way of escape from this wintry landscape and
fioni every memory of the buffoon who had cheated</p>
<p>ZIZ t H E TREE</p>
<p>him, he slowly descended the hill, pushed open die
broken gate, and entered the icy untended g^den.</p>
<p>Once more he came to a standstill in his frieze coat,
and from under the brim of his hard hat stared up into
the huge frigid branches. There is a supple lift
and ease in the twigs of a tree asleep in winter. Green
living buds are everywhere huddling close in their
drowsy defences. Even the Fruit Merchant could
distinguish between the dreaming and the dead, or,
at any rate, between the unripe and the rotten.</p>
<p>And as he looked, two thoughts scurried like rats
out of the wainscot of his mind. An imprecedented
foreboding descended on him. These lean shrunken
twigs, these massive vegetable bones ‚Äî the tree was
dead. And up there ‚Äî he shifted rapidly to and fro
in order to secure an uninterrupted view of a kind of ^
huddling shape up aloft there, an object that appeared &rsquo;
to be stooping crazily forward as if on a similar
quest in respect to himself.</p>
<p>But, no. He took a deep breath. The muffled
knocking against the wall of his head ceased. He
need not have alarmed himself : an optical illusion.
Nothing.</p>
<p>The tree ti^as dead. That was clear ‚Äî a gaunt,
black, sapless nightmare. But the ungainly clump
and shape, hoisted midway among its boughs was
not a huddling human body. It was only yet another
kind of derelict parasite ‚Äî withered mistletoe. And
that gentle spellican-like tattling high overhead was
but the fingering of a faint breeze in the moonlight ;
clacking twig against twig.</p>
<p>Maybe it would have simplified matters if</p>
<p>t H E TREE i23</p>
<p>But no need to dwell on that. One corpse at a time
was enough for any man on a night like this and
in a country as cheerless as the plains of Gomorrah.
A phrase or two out of his familiar bills of lading
recurred to the Fruit Merchant‚Äôs mind ‚Äî ‚Äúthe act of
God.‚Äù There was something so horrific in the
contorted set of the branches outthrust in ungainly
menace above his head that he was reminded of no
less a depravity than the devil himself. Thank the
Lord, his half-brother had not remembered to send
him a parcel of the fruit.</p>
<p>If ever poison showed in a plant, it haunted every
knot and knuckle of this tree. Judgment had over-
taken it ‚Äî the act of God. That‚Äôs what came of
boasting. That‚Äôs what came of idling a useless life
away in a daydream at other people‚Äôs expense. And
now the cunning bird was flown. The insult of his
half-brother‚Äôs triumph stabbed the Fruit Merchant
like a sword.</p>
<p>A sudden giddiness, the roar as of water, caused in
part no doubt by the posture of his head, again swept</p>
<ul>
<li>over him, reverberated in his ears. He thrust a
cautious hand into the breast of his coat and lowered
his eyes. They came to a stay on the rugged moonlit
bole. And there, with a renewed intensity of gaze,
they once mote fixed themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>The natural living bark of the tree had been of a
russet grey, resembling that of the beech. Apart
from a peculiar shimmeringness due to the frost that
crystalled it over, and as the skin of a dead thing,
that bark now suggested the silveriness of leprosy.
So far, so good. But midway up the unbranched</p>
<p>THE TREE</p>
<p>2.Z4</p>
<p>bole, at the height of five to six feet from the ground,
appeared a wide peculiar cicatrice. The iridescent
greyness here abruptly ended. Above it stretched
a clear blank ring of darker colour, knobbed over,
in and out, with tiny sparkling clusters of fungi.</p>
<p>The Fruit Merchant stole in a pace or two. Nc^
feat of the inhuman this. Cleardy and precisely the
thick rind of the tree must some time since have been
cut and pared away in a wide equal ring ; a ring too
far from the ground to have been the work of pigs
or goats, too smooth and sharp-edged to have been
caused by the gnawings of cattle. It was perfectly
plain ; the sap-protecting skin of the thing had been
deliberately cut and hacked away. The tree had been
murdered. High in the moonlit heavens it gloated
there : a victim.</p>
<p>Not until then did the Fruit Merchant stealthily
turn and once more survey his half-brother‚Äôs house.
The slow and almost furtive movement of his head
and shoulders suggested that the action was invol-
untary. From this garden side the aspect of the
hovel was even more abject and disconsolate. Its
one ivy-clustered chimney-stack was smokeless. The
moonbeams rained softly and mercilessly on the
flint walls, the boarded windows, the rat-and-bitd-
ravaged thatch.</p>
<p>Only a spectre could be content with such a
dwelling, and a guilt-stricken wretch at that. Yet
without any doubt in the world the house was still in-
habited. For even now a slender amber beam of light
leaned out at an obtuse angle from some crevice in the
shuttering wood into the vast bath of moonshine.</p>
<p>THE TREE</p>
<p>Z25</p>
<p>For a moment the Fruit Merchant hesitated. He
could leave the garden and regain his cab without
nearing the house. He could yet once more ‚Äúwash
his hands.‚Äù Certainly, after sight of the maniac‚Äôs
treacherous work on his xmique God-given tree he
hadn‚Äôt the faintest vestige of a desire to confront his
half-brother. Quite the reverse. He would far rather
fling a second hundred pounds after the first than
be once more contaminated by his company. There
was something vile in his surroundings.</p>
<p>In shadows black as pitch, like these, any incon-
ceivably evil creature might lie in covert. If the
tree alive could decoy an alien fauna to its succulent
nectar, the tree dead might well invite even less
pleasing ministrations. Come what come would,
he was prepared. It might startle him ; but he was
dead-cold already ; and when your whole mind is
filled with disgust and disquiet there is no room for
physical fear. You merely want to shake yourself
free ‚Äî edge out and be off.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the human intruder in this inhuman
wilderness was already, and with infinite caution,
making his way towards the house. On a pitch-
black night he might have hesitated. Hadn‚Äôt veno-
mous serpents the habit of stealing for their winter
slumber into the crannies and hollows of fallen
wood ? Might not even the lightest northern zephyr
bring down upon his head another vast baulk of
timber from the withered labyrinth above ? But
so bright was the earth‚Äôs lanthorn, so still the starry
sky, that he could hear and even see the seeds from
the humbler winter weeds scattering out from their</p>
<p>226 THE T R E E</p>
<p>yawning pods, as, with exquisite cate, he brushed on
through the tangling growths around him.</p>
<p>And having at length closely approached the walls,
standing actually within a jutting shadow, he paused
yet again and took a deep breath into his body before,
gently lifting himself, he set his eye to the crevice
from which poured out that slender shaft of light.</p>
<p>So artificially brilliant was the room within ‚Äî by
comparison with the full moonlight of the Fruit
Merchant‚Äôs natural world without ‚Äî that for an instant
or two he saw nothing. But he persevered, and
after a while his round protruding eye found itself
master of at least half the space on the other side
of the shutters. Stilled through and through, his
fingers clutching the frosted sill, he stood there
haff suspended on his toes, and as if hypnotised.</p>
<p>For scarcely more than a yard distant from his
own there stooped a face ‚Äî his half-brother‚Äôs : a face
to haunt you to your dying day. It was surmounted
by a kind of nightcap, and was almost unrecog-
nisable. The unfolding of the hours of twelve
solitary years had played havoc with the once-
familiar features. The projecting brows above the
angular cheek-bones resembled polished stone. The
ears stood out like the vans of a bat on either side
above the corded neck. The thin unkempt beard
on the narrow jaw brushed the long gnarled hand
that was moving with an infinite tedious care on the
bare table beneath it.</p>
<p>Motionlessly the hanging paraffin lamp poured its
radiance upon this engrossed cadaverous visage,
revealing every line and bone, hollow and wrinlue*</p>
<p>t H E TREE 227</p>
<p>Nevertheless its possessor, this old mao, shrunken
and hideous in his frame of abject poverty, his arms
drawn close up to his fallen body, worked sedulously
on and on. And behind and around him showed
the fruit of his labours. Pinned to the scaling walls,
propped on the ramshackle shelf above his fireless
hearthstone, and even against the stale remnant of
a loaf of bread on the cracked blue dish beside him,
was a litter of pictures. And everywhere, lovely
and marvellous in all its guises ‚Äî the tree. The tree
in May‚Äôs showering loveliness, in summer‚Äôs quiet
wonder, in autumn‚Äôs decline, in naked slumbering
wintry grace. The colours glowed from the fine old
rough paper like lamps and gems.</p>
<p>There were drawings of birds too, birds of daz-
zling plumage, of flowers and butterflies, their
crimson and emerald, rose and saffron seemingly
shimmering and astir ; their every mealy and
feathery and pollened boss and petal and plume on
fire with hoarded life and beauty. And there a viper
with its sinuous molten scales ; and there a face and
a shape looking out of its nothingness such as
would awake even a dreamer in a dream.</p>
<p>Only three sounds in that night-quiet, and these
scarcely discernible, stirred in the watcher‚Äôs ear :
the faint shrill sing-song of the flame of the lamp,
the harsh wheezy breath of the artist, and a faint
scuttling as of rats or mice. This austere and dying
creature must have come in at last from the world
of nature and mankind a long time ago. The arm
tluit had given the tree its quietus had now not the
strength to lift an axe. Yet the ungainly fingers
toiled assiduously on.</p>
<p>228 T H E T R E E</p>
<p>The Fruit Merchant, spying in on the old half-
starved being that sat there, burning swiftly away
among his insane gewgaws, as nearly broke out
crying as laughing. He was frightened and elated ;
mute and bursting with words. The act of God !
Rather than even remotely resemble that old scare-
crow in his second childhood pushing that tiny-
bladed knife across the surface of a flat of wood, he</p>
<p>would . An empty and desolate look stole into the</p>
<p>gaaing eye.</p>
<p>Not that he professed to imd^rstand. He knew
nothing. His head was completely empty. The
last shred of rage and vindictiveness had vanished
away. He was glad he had come, for now he was
going back. What little of the present and future
remained would soon be the past. He, too, was
ageing. His life also was coming to an end. He
stared on ‚Äî oh, yes. And not even a nephew to
inherit his snug fat little fortune. Worldly goods,
shipload on shipload ‚Äî well, since he could not take
them away with him, he would leave them behind.
He would bequeath them to charity, to the
W.F.M.P.A. perhaps ; and he would make a note of
the hundred pounds.</p>
<p>Not in mdice; only to leave things business-like
and in order ; to do your duty by a greedy and un-
grateful world even though you were soon to be
washing your hands of that, too. All waste, nothing
but waste. But he thanked the Lord he had kept his
samty, that he was respected ; that he wasn‚Äôt in the
artificial fruit trade ‚Äî the stuff your grandmother
belled under glass. He thanked the Lord he wasn‚Äôt</p>
<p>THE TREE 2^9</p>
<p>foul to look at ; foul probably to smell ; and a
poison even to think about.</p>
<p>Yet still he peeped on ‚Äî this old Tom, though at
no Lady Godiva. ‚ÄúThey‚Äù would buy right enough
‚Äî there was no doubt of that. Christie‚Äôs would
some day be humming with the things. He didn‚Äôt
deny the old lunatic that. He knew a bird when he
saw it ‚Äî even on paper. Ninety-seven guineas : at
that rate there was more money swimming about in
this pestilent hovel than ever even he himself could
lay his practised hands on.</p>
<p>And there were fools in plenty ‚Äî rich, dabbling,
affected, silly fools ‚Äî dillytanties,you called ‚Äôem ‚Äî ^who
would never know that their lying, preposterous
P. P. had destroyed the very life of the tree that
had given its all for him. And why ? And why ?
The Fruit Merchant was almost tempted to burn
down the miserable cabin over his half-brother‚Äôs
head. Who could tell ? . . . A gust of wind</p>
<p>stirred in the bedraggled thatch, feebly whined in the
keyhole.</p>
<p>And at that moment, as if an angry and helpless
thought could make itself audible even above the
hungry racketing of mice and the melancholic
whistling of a paraffin lamp ‚Äî at that moment the
corpse-like countenance, almost within finger-touch
on the other side of the table, slowly raised itself
from the labour of its regard, and appeared to be
searching through the shutter‚Äôs cranny as if into the
ft Fruit Merchant‚Äôs brain. The glance swept through
him like an avalanche. No, no. But one instan-
taneous confrontation, and he had pushed himself</p>
<p>230 THE TREE</p>
<p>back ftom the impious walls as softly as an immense</p>
<p>sack of hay.</p>
<p>These were not eyes ‚Äî in that abominable count-
enance. Speck-pupilled, greenish-grey, unfocused,
under their protuberant mat of eyebrow, they re-
mained still as a salt and stagnant sea. And in their
uplifted depths, stretching out into endless distances,
the Fruit Merchant had seen regions of a country
whence neither for love nor money he could ever
harvest one fruit, one pip, one cankered bud. And
blossoming there beside a glassy stream in the mid-
distance of far-mountained sward ‚Äî a tree. . .</p>
<p>In after-years an old, fat, vulgar, and bronchitic
figure, muffled up in a pathetic shawl, would some-
times be seen seated in a place of honour, its hard
square hat upon its thick bald skull, within positive
reach of the jovial auctioneer‚Äôs ivory hammer. To
purchase every ‚ÄúP. P.‚Äù that came into tlie market
was a dream beyond even a multi-millionaire‚Äôs
avarice. But small beetles or grubs or single
feathers drawn ‚Äúfrom the life‚Äù were within scope of
the Fruit Merchant‚Äôs purse. The eye that showed
not the faintest vestige of reflected glory from the
orange of the orange, the gamboge of the lemon, or
the russet bronze of the pomegranate ‚Äî ^in their
crated myriads ‚Äî would fitfully light up awhile as one
by one, and with reiterated grunts of satisfaction,
he afterwards in the secrecy of his home consigned
these indifferent and ‚Äú early‚Äù works of art to the
flames.</p>
<p>But since his medical man has warned him that
any mamfestation of passion would almost unquest-</p>
<p>THE TREE</p>
<p>231</p>
<p>ionably prove his ultimate manifestation of anything,
he steadily avoided thinking of the tree. Yet there it
remained, unexorcisable, ineradicable, in his fading
imagination.</p>
<p>Indeed, he finally expired in the small hours one
black winter‚Äôs morning, and as peacefully as a child,
having dreamed that he was looking through a
crevice into what could not be hell, but might be
limbo or purgatory, the place of departed spirits.
For there sat his half-brother, quite, quite still.
And aU around him, to be seen, haunted gay and
painted birds and crystal flowers and damasked
butterflies ; and, as it were, sylphs and salamanders,
shapes of an unearthly beauty. And all of them
strangely, preternaturally still, as if in a peepshow,
as if stuffed.</p>
<p>OUT OF THE DEEP</p>
<p>T he steely light of d^break, increasing in vol-
ume and intensity as the East grew larger with
the day, showed clearly at length that the
prodigious yet elegant Arabian bed was empty. What
might tenderly have cradled the slumbers of some ex-
quisite Fair of romance now contained no human oc-
cupant at all. The whole immense room ‚Äî its air dry
and thin as if burnt ‚Äî was quiet as a sepulchre.</p>
<p>To the right of the bed towered a vast and heavily
carved wardrobe. To the left, a iofty fire place of stone
flanked by its grinning frigid dogs. A few cumbrous
and obscure oil paintings hung on the walls. And,
like the draperies of a proscenium, the fringed and
valanced damask curtains on either side the two high
windows, poured down their motionless cataract of
crimson.</p>
<p>They had been left undrawn over night, and yet
gave the scene a slight theatricality, a theatricality
which the painted nymphs disporting themselves on
the ceiUng scarcely helped to dispel.</p>
<p>Not that these coy and ogling faces suggested any
vestige of chagrin at the absence of the young man
who for some weeks past had shared the long nights
with them. They merely smiled on. For, after all, Jim-
mie‚Äôs restless head upon the pillow had never really
been in harmony with his pompous inanimate sur-
roundings ‚Äî ^the thin high nose, like the beak of a
small smp, between the fast-sealed lids and narrow
cheekbones, the narrow bird-like brow, the shell of
the ear slightly pointed. If, inspired by the distant</p>
<p>OUT OF THE DEEP 235</p>
<p>music of the spheres, the painted creatures had with
this daybreak broken into song, it would certainly
not have been to the tune of ‚ÄúOh where, and oh
where is my little dog gone ?‚Äù There was even less
likelihood of Jimmie‚Äôs voice now taking up their
strains from out of the distance.</p>
<p>And yet, to judge from appearances, the tongue
within that head might have been that of an extremely
vivacious talker ‚Äî even though, apart from Mrs.
Thripps, its talk these last few days had been for the
most part with himself.</p>
<p>Indeed, as one of his friends had remarked : ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt
you believe it. Jimmie has pots and pots to say, though
he don‚Äôt say it. That‚Äôs what makes him such a dam
good loser.‚Äù Whether or not ; if Jimmie had been in
the habit of conversing with himself, he must have
had odd company at times.</p>
<p>Night after night he had lain there, flat on his back,
his hands crossed on his breast ‚Äî a pose that never
failed to amuse him. A smooth eminence in the dark
rich quilt about sixty inches from his chin indicated
to his attentive eye fhe points of his toes. The hours
had been heavy, the hours had been long ‚Äî still there
are only twelve or so of utter darkness in the most
tedious of nights, and matins tinkles at length. Ex-
cepting the last of them ‚Äî a night, which was now
apparently for ever over, he had occupied this
majestic bed for about six weeks, though on no single
occasion could he have confessed to being really at
home in it.</p>
<p>He had chosen it, not from any characteristic whim
or caprice, and certainly not because it dominated the</p>
<p>Q</p>
<p>OUT OF THE DEEP</p>
<p>2}4</p>
<p>room in which his Uncle Timothy himself used to
sleep, yes, and forforty years on end, only at last to ex-
pire in it. He had chosen it because, when its Venetian
blinds were pulled high up under the fringed cornice,
it was as light as a London April sky could make it ;
and because ‚Äî ^weU, just one single glance in from
the high narrow doorway upstairs had convinced him
that the attic in which he was wont to sleep as a small
boy was simply out of the question. A black heavy
flood of rage swept over him at sight of it ‚Äî he had
never before positively reaUsed the abominations of
that early past. To a waif and stray any kind of shelter
is, of course, a godsend, but even though this huge
sumptuous barrack of a house had been left to him (or,
rather, abandoned to him) by his Uncle Timothy‚Äôs
relict, Aunt Charlotte, Jimmie coxild not ‚Äî even at nis
loosest ‚Äî have been described as homeless.</p>
<p>Friendless rather ‚Äî but that of his own deliberate
choice. Not so very long ago, in fact, he had made a
clean sweep of every single living Iseing, male or
female, to whom the term friend could, with some
little elasticity, be applied. A little official affair, to put
it politely, eased Aeir exit. And then, this vacant
hostel. The house, in fact (occupied only by a care-
taker in the service of his Aunt‚Äôs lawyers) ^d been
his for the asking at any time during the last two or
three years. But he had steadily delayed taking pos-
session of it until there was practically no alternative.</p>
<p>Circumstances accustom even a young man to a
good many inconveniences. Still it would have been
a little too quixotic to sleep in the street, even though
his Uncle Timothy‚Äôs house, as mere ‚Äúproperty,‚Äù was</p>
<p>OUT OF THE DEEP 235</p>
<p>little better than a white and unpleasing elephant. He
could not sell it, that is, not tn masse. It was mote than
dubious if he was legally entitled to make away with
its contents.</p>
<p>But, quite apart from an extreme aversion to your
Uncle Timothy‚Äôs valuables in themselves, you can-
not eat, even if you can subsist on, articles of virtu.
Sir Richard Grenville ‚Äî a hero for whom Jimmie had
every respect ‚Äî may have been accustomed to chew-
ing up his wine-glass after swigging off its contents.
But this must have been on the spur of an impulse,
hardly in obedience to the instinct of self-preservation.
Jimmie would have much preferred to balance a chair
it the foot of his Uncle‚Äôs Arabian bed and salute the
smiling lips of the painted nymphs on the ceiling.
Though even that experiment would probably have a
rather gritty flavour. Still, possession is nine points
of the law, and necessity is the deadly enemy of con-
vention. Jimmie was unconscious of the faintest
scruples on that score.</p>
<p>His scruples, indeed, were in another direction.
Only a few days ago ‚Äî the day, in fact, before his first
indulgence in the queer experience of pulling the bell
‚Äî ^he ^d sallied out w&rsquo;ith his Aunt Charlotte‚Äôs black
leather dressing bag positively bulging with a pair of
Bow candlesticks, an illuminated missal, mutely ex-
&lt;^uisite, with its blues and golds and crimsons, and a
tiny old silver-gUt bijouterie box. He was a young
man of absurdly impulsive aversions, and the dealer
to whom he carried this further consignment of loot
was one of them.</p>
<p>After a rapid and contemptuous examination, this</p>
<p>OUT OF THE DEEP</p>
<p>236</p>
<p>gentleman spread out his palms, shrugged his shoul-
ders, and suggested a sum that would have caused
even a more phlegmatic connoisseur than his cus-
tomer‚Äôs Uncle Timodiy to turn in his grave.</p>
<p>And Jimmie replied, nicely slurring fus r‚Äôs, ‚ÄúReally
Mr. So-and-so, it is impossible. No doubt the things
have an artificial value, but not for me. I must ask
you to oblige me by giving me only half the sum you
have kindly mentioned. Rather than accept figure,
you know, I would ‚Äî well, perhaps it would be im-
polite to tell you what I wo dd prefer to do. Dies irae,
dies ilia, and so on.‚Äù</p>
<p>The dealer flushed, though he had been apparently
content to leave it at that. He was not the man to be
easily insulted by a good customer. And Jimmie‚Äôs
depredations were methodical. With the fastidious-
ness of an expert he selected from the rare and costly
contents of the house only what was light and port-
able and became inconspicuous by its absence. The
supply he realised, though without any perceptible
animation, however recklessly it might be squandered,
would easily last out his lifetime.</p>
<p>Certainly not. After having once made up his mind
to accepthis Uncle Timothy‚Äôs posthumous hospitality,
the real diflSculty was unlikely to be a conscientious
one. It was the attempt merely to accustom himself
to the house ‚Äî ^the hated house ‚Äî ^that grew more and
more arduous. It falsified his hope that, like other ex-
periences, this one would prove only the more
pi&lt;juant for being so precarious. Days and moments
quickly flying ‚Äî ^just his one funny old charwoman,
]^s. Tlmpps, himself, and the Past.</p>
<p>OUT OF THE DEEP 237</p>
<p>After pausing awhile under the dingy and dusty
portico, Jimmie had entered into his inheritance on
the last afternoon in March. The wind was fallen ; the
day was beginning to narrow ; a chill crystal light
hung over the unshuttered staircase. By sheer force of
a forgotten habit he at once ascended to the attic in
which he had slept as a child</p>
<p>Pausing on the threshold, hedooked in, conscious
not so much of the few familiar sticks of furniture ‚Äî
the trucklebed, the worn strip of Brussels carpet, the
chipped blue-banded ewer and basin, the framed
illuminated texts on the walls ‚Äî as of a perfect hive of
abhorrent memories.</p>
<p>That high cupboard in the corner from which cer-
tain bodiless shapes had been wont to issue and stoop
at him cowering out of his dreams ; the crab-patterned
paper that came alive as you stared ; the window cold
with menacing stats ; the mouseholes, the rusty grate
‚Äî ^trumpet of every wind that blows ‚Äî these objects at
once lustily shouted at him in their own original ton-
gues.</p>
<p>Quite apart from themselves, they reminded him of
incidents and experiences which at the time could
scarcely have been so nauseous as they now seemed
in retrospect. He found himself suffocatingly resent-
ful even of what must have been kindly intentions.
He remembered how his Aunt Charlotte used to read
to him ‚Äî with her puffy cheeks, plump ringed hands,
and the moving orbs of her eyes showing under her
spectacles.</p>
<p>He wasn‚Äôt exactly accusing the past. Even in his
first breeches he was never what could be called a</p>
<p>1 ^% OUTOFTHEDEEP</p>
<p>nice little boy. He had never ordered himself lowly
and reverently to any of his betters ‚Äî at least in their
absence. Nevertheless, what stirred in his bosom as
he gazed in on this discarded scene was certainly not
remorse.</p>
<p>He remembered how gingerly and with what pecu-
liar breathings, his Uncle Timothy used to lift his mi-
croscope out of its wooden case ; and how, after the
necessary manipulation of the instrument, he himself
would be bidden mount a footstool and fix his daz-
zled eye on the slides of slugg^ ;h or darting horrors
of minute magnified ‚Äúlife.‚Äù And how, after a steady
um-aw-ing drawl of inapprehensible instruction, his
uncle would suddenly flick out a huge silk pocket
handkerchief as a signal that little tongue-tied nervous
boys were themselves nothing but miserable sluggish
or darting reptiles, and that lus nephew was the most
deplorable kind of little boy.</p>
<p>Jimmie remembered, too,&lsquo;once asking the loose bow-
shaped old gentleman in his chair if he might himself
twist the wheel ; and his Uncle Timothy had replied
in a loud ringing voice, and almost as if he were ad-
dressing a public meeting : ‚ÄúUm, ah, my boy, I say
No to tl^it !‚Äù He said No to most things, and just
like that, if he vouchsafed speech at all.</p>
<p>And then there was Church on Sundays ; and his
hoop on weekdays in the Crescent ; and days when,
with nothing to do, little Jimmie had been wont to sit
watching the cold silvery rain on the window, the body
he was in slowly congealing the while into a specibs
of rancid suet pudding. Mornings too, when his Aunt
Charlotte would talk nasally to him about Christian-</p>
<p>OUT OF THE DEEP 239</p>
<p>ity ; or when he was allowed to help his Uncle and
a tall scared parlourmaid dust and re-arrange the con-
tents of a cabinet or bureau. The smell of the air, the
check duster, the odious ohjets d&rsquo;art and the ageing
old man snorting and lool^g like a superannuated
Silenus beside the neat and frightened parlourmaid
‚Äî it was a curious thing ; though Death with his
louring grin had beckoned him off : there he, was ‚Äî
alive as ever.</p>
<p>And when amid these ruminations, Jimmie‚Äôs eyes
had at last fixed themselves on the frayed dangling
cord that hung from the ceiling over the trucklebed,it
was because he had already explored all that the name
Soames had stood for. Soames the butler ‚Äî a black-
clothed, tub-bellied, pompous man that might have
been his Uncle Timothy‚Äôs impoverished first cousin
or illegitimate step-brother : Soames ; Soames.</p>
<p>Soames used frequently to wring Jimmie‚Äôs then
protuberant ears. Soames sneaked habitually ; and
with a sort of gloating piety on his drooping face, was
invariably present at the subsequent castigation.
Soames had been wont to pile up his plate with lumps
of fat that even Destiny had never intended should
consort with any single leg of mutton or even sirloin
of beef ‚Äî jelly-like, rapidly cooling nuggets of fat. And
Soames invariably brought him cold rice pudding
when there was hot ginger roU.</p>
<p>Jimmie remembered the lines that drooped down
from his pale long nose. The sleek set of his whiskers
as he stood there in his coat-tails reflected in the glass
of die sideboard, carving the Sunday joint.</p>
<p>But that slack green beU-cordI‚Äî his very first glimpse</p>
<p>240 OUT OF THE DEEP</p>
<p>of it had set waggling score, of peculiar remem-
brances. First, and not so very peculiarly, perhaps, it
recalled an occasion when, as he stood before his
Aunt‚Äôs footstool to bid her Good-night, her aggrieved
pupils had visibly swum down from beneath their lids
out of a nap, to fix themselves and look at him at last
as if neither he nor she, either in this or in any other
world, had ever so much as seen one another before.
Perhaps his own face, if not so puffy, appeared that
evening to be unusually pasty and pallid ‚Äî with those
dark rings which even to this day added vivacity and
lustre to his extremely clear eyes. And his Aunt Char-
lotte had asked him why he was such a cowardly boy
and so wickedly frightened of the dark.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou know very well your dear Uncle will not
permit gas in the attic, so there‚Äôs no use asking for it.
You have nothing on your conscience, I trust ? You
have not been talking to the servants ?‚Äù</p>
<p>Infallible liar, he had shaken his head. And his
Aunt Charlotte in return wagged hers at him.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no good staring in that rebellious sullen way
at me. I have told you repeatedly that if you are reallv
in need of anything, just ring the bell for Soames. A
good little boy with nothing on his conscience kfims
that God watches over him. I hope you are at least
trying to be a good little boy. There is a limit even
to your Uncle‚Äôs forbearance.‚Äù</p>
<p>It was perfectly true. Even bad little boys might be
‚Äúwatched over‚Äù in the dead of night, and as for his
Uncle Timothy‚Äôs forbearance, he had discovered the
limitations of that fairly early in life.</p>
<p>Well, it was a pity, he snuled to himself, that his</p>
<p>OUT OF THE DEEP 24I</p>
<p>Aunt Charlotte could not be present to see his Uncle
Timothy‚Äôs bedroom on that first celebration of their
jtodigal nephew‚Äôs return. Jimmie‚Äôs first foray had
seen to range the house from attic to cellar T where he
lad paused to rest) for candlesticks. And that night
something like six dozen of the ‚Äúbest wax‚Äù watched
over his heavy and galvanic slumbers in the Arabian
bed. Aunt Charlotte, now rather more accustomed
to the dark even than Jimmie himself, would have
opened her eyes at that.</p>
<p>Gamblers are naturally superstitious folk, he sup-
posed ; but that was the queerest feature of the whole
thing. He had not then been conscious of even the
slightest apprehension or speculation. It was far rather
a kind of ribaldry than any sort of foreboding that
had lit up positive constellations of candles as if for
a Prince‚Äôs ‚Äî as if for a princely Cardinal‚Äôs ‚Äî lying-in-
state.</p>
<p>It had taken a devil of a time too. His Uncle Timo-
thy‚Äôs port was not the less potent for a long spell of
obscure mellowing, and the hand that held the taper
had been a shaky one. Yet it had proved an amusing
process too. Almost childish. Jimmie hadn‚Äôt laughed
like that for years. Certainly until then he had been
unconscious of the feeblest squeamish inkling of
anything ‚Äî apart from old remembrances ‚Äî peculiar
in the house. And yet ‚Äî ^well, no doubt even the
first absurd imptilsive experiment that followed bad
shaken him up.</p>
<p>Its result would have been less unexpected if he
hadn‚Äôt made a point and almost a duty of continually
patrolling the horrible old vacant London mansion.</p>
<p>242 OUT OF THE DEEP</p>
<p>Hardly a day had lately passed ‚Äî ^and there was nothing
better to do ‚Äî but it found him on his rounds. He was
not waiting for anything (except for the hour, maybe,
when he would have to wait no more). Nevertheless,
faithful as the sentinel on Elsinore‚Äôs hoary ramparts,
he would find himself day after day treading almost
catlike on from room to room, surveying ms para-
doxical inheritance, jotting down a list in a nice
order of the next ‚Äúsacrifices,‚Äù grimacing at the Ming
divinities, and pirouetting an occasional long ndse
at the portraits on the w^s.</p>
<p>He had sometimes had a few words ‚Äî animated
ones, too ‚Äî ^with Mrs. Thripps, and perhaps if he
could have persuaded himself to talk ‚Äúsensibly,‚Äù and
not to gesticulate, not to laugh himself so easily into a
fit of coughing, she would have proved better com-
pany. She was amazingly honest and punctual and
quiet ; and why to Heaven a woman with such excel-
lent qualities should customarily wear so scared a
gleam in her stiU, colourless eyes, and be so idiotically
timi d and nervous in his company, he could not im-
agine.</p>
<p>She was being paid handsome wages anyhow ; and,
naturally, he was aware of no rooted objection to
other people helping themselves ; at least if they
managed it as skilfully as he did himself. But Mrs.
Thripps, it seemed, had never been able in any sense
at all to help herself. She was simply a crape-bonneted
‚Äúmotherly‚Äù creature, if not excessively intelligent, if a
little slow in seeing ‚Äúpoints.‚Äù It was, indeed, her
alarm when heaskedher if she had happened to notice
any young man about the house tnat had irritated</p>
<p>OUTOFTHEDEEP 243</p>
<p>him ‚Äî ^though, of course, it was hardly fair not to ex-
plain what had given rise to the question. That was
perfectly simple. It was like this. ‚Äî</p>
<p>For years ‚Äî ^for centuries, in fact ‚Äî Jimmie had been,
except in certain unusual circumstances, an exceed-
ingly bad sleeper. He still hated sleeping in the dark.
But a multitude of candles at various degrees of ex-
haustion make rather lively company when you are
sick of your Uncle Timot%‚Äôs cellar. And even the
best of vintage wines may prove an ineffectual sopor-
ific. His, too, was a wretchedly active mind.</p>
<p>Even as a boy he had thought a good deal about
his Uncle and Aunt, and Soames, and the house, and
theRev. Mr. Grayson, andspectres, and schoolmasters,
and painted nymphs, and running away to sea, and
curios, and dead silence, and his early childhood. And
though, since then, other enigmas had engaged his
attention, this purely automatic and tiresome activity
of mind still persisted.</p>
<p>On his oath he had been in some respects and in
secret rather a goody-goody little boy ; though his
piety had been rather the off-spring of fear than of love.
Had he not been expelled from MeUish‚Äôs almost solely
for that reason ? What on earth was the good of
repeatedly thrashing a boy when you positively
knew that he has lied merely from terror of your
roaring voice and horrible white face ?</p>
<p>But there it was ; if there had been someone to talk
to, he would not have talked so much to himself. He
would not have lain awake thinking, night after
ni^ht, like a rat in a trap. Thinking was like a foun-
tain. Once it gets going at a certain pressure, well, it</p>
<p>244 OUT OP THE DEEP</p>
<p>is almost impossible to turn it off. And, my hat I
what odd thmgs come up with the water 1</p>
<p>On the particular night in question, in spite of the
candles and the mice and the moon, he badly wanted
company. In a moment of pining yet listless jocosity,
then, he had merely taken his Aunt Charlotte‚Äôs advice.
True, the sumptuous crimson pleated silk bell-pull,
dangling like a serpent with a huge tassel for skull
over his Uncle Timothy‚Äôs pillow, was a more formid-
able instrument than the yard or two of frayed gr&lt;jen
cord in the attic. Yet they shared the same purpose.
Many a time must his Uncle Timothy have stretched
up a large loose hand in that direction when in need
of Soames‚Äôs nocturnal ministrations. And now, alas,
both master and man were long since gone the way of
all flesh. You couldn‚Äôt, it appeared, pull bells in your
coffin.</p>
<p>But Jimmie was not as yet in his coffin, and as soon
as his fingers slipped down from the smooth pull, the
problem, in the abstract, as it were, began to fascin-
ate him. With cold froggy hands crossed over his
beautiful puce-pattemed pyjamas, he lay staring at
the crimson tassel till he had actually seen the hidden
fangs flickeringly jet out at him.</p>
<p>The effort, then, must have needed some little cour-
age. It might almost have needed a tinge of inspiration.
It was in no sense intended as a challenge. He would,
in fact, rather remain alone than chance summoning
‚Äî ^well, any (once animate) relic of the distant past^
But obviously the most practical way of proving
‚Äî ^if only to yourself ‚Äî that you can be content witia
your own reconnaissances in the very dead of night.</p>
<p>OUTOF THEDEEP 245</p>
<p>was to demonstrate to that self that, even if you
should ask for it, assistance would not be forthcoming.</p>
<p>He had been as fantastic as that. At the prolonged,
julsating, faint, distant tintinnabulation he had fallen
jack on to his piUow with an absurd little quicket of
aughter, like that of a naughty boy up to mischief.
But instant sobriety followed. Poor sleepers should
endeavour to compose themselves. Tampering with
empty space, stirring up echoes in pitch-black pits
of darkness is scarcely sedative. And then, as he lay
striving with extraordinary fervour not to listen, but
to concentrate his mind on the wardrobe, and to
keep his eyes from the door, that door must gently
have opened.</p>
<p>It must have opened, and as noiselessly closed
again. For a more or less decent-looking young man,
seemingly not a day older than himself was now ap-
parent in the room. It might almost be said that he
had insinuated himself into the room. But well-trained
domestics are accustomed to move their limbs and
bodies with a becoming unobtrusiveness. There, was
also that familiar slight inclination of the apologetic
in this young man‚Äôs pose, as he stood there solitary
in his black, in that terrific blaze of candle light. And
for a sheer solid minute the occupant of the Arabian
bed had. really stopped thinking.</p>
<p>When indeed you positively press your face, so to
speak, against the crystalline window of your eyes,
your mind is apt to become a perfect vacuum.
And Jimmie‚Äôs first rapid and instinctive ‚ÄúWho the
devil . . .?‚Äù had rcmamed inaudible.</p>
<p>In the course of the next few days Jimmie was to</p>
<p>246 OUT OF THE DEEP</p>
<p>become familiar (at least in memory) with the looks
of this new young butler or valet. But first impressions
are usually the vividest. The dark blue-grey eyes, the
high nose, the scarcely perceptible smile, the slight
stoop of the shoulders ‚Äî there was no doubt of it.
There was just a flavour, a flicker, there,of resemblance
to himself. Not that he himself could ever have cut
as respectful and respectable a figure as that. And the
smile ! ‚Äî the fellow seemed to be ruminating over a
thousand dubious, long-interred secrets, secrets such
as one may be a little cautious of digging up even
to share with one‚Äôs self.</p>
<p>His face turned sidelong on his pillow, and through
air as visibly transparent as a sheet of glass, Jimmie
had steadily regarded this strange bell-answerer ; and
the bell-answerer had never so much as stirred his
frigid glittering eyes in response. The silence that
hung between them produced eventually a peculiar
effect on Jimmie. Menials as a general rule should be
less emphatic personally. Their unobtrusiveness
should surely not emphasise their immanence. It had
been Jimmie who was the first to withdraw his eyes,
only once more to find them settling as if spellbound
on those of his visitor.</p>
<p>Yet, after all, there was nothing to take offence at
in the young man‚Äôs countenance or attitude. He did
not seem even to be thinking-back at the bell-puller ;
but merely to be awaiting instructions. Yet Jimmie‚Äôs
heart at once rapidly began to beat again beneath his
icy hands. And at last he made a perfectly idiotic
response.</p>
<p>Wagging his head on his pillow, he turned abruptly</p>
<p>OUT OF THE DEEP 247</p>
<p>away. ‚ÄúIt was only to tell you that I shall need no-
thing more to-night,‚Äù he had said.</p>
<p>Good Heavens. The fatuity of it ! He wanted,
thirsted for, scores upon scores of things. Aladdin‚Äôs
was the cupidity of a simpleton by comparison. Time,
and the past, for mstance, and the ability to breathe
again as easily as if it were natural ‚Äî as natural as the
processes of digestion. Why, if you were intent only
on a little innocent companionship, one or two of
those nymphs up there would be far more amusing
company than Mrs. Thripps. If, that is, apart from
yearning to their harps and viols, they could have
been persuaded to scrub and sweep. Jimmie wanted
no other kind of help. There is a beauty that is but
skin-deep.</p>
<p>Altogether it had been a far from satisfactory ex-
perience. Jimmie was nettled. His mincing tones
echoed on in his mind. They must have suggested that
he was unaccustomed to menservants and beU-pulls
and opulent surroundings. And the fellow had in-
stantly taken him at his word. A solemn little rather
agreeable and unservUe inclination of the not un-
friendly head ‚Äî and he was gone.</p>
<p>And there was Jimmie, absolutely exhausted,
coughing his lungs out, and entirely incapable of
condudmg whether the new butler was a creature of
actuality or of dream. Well, well, well : that was
nothing new. That‚Äôs just how things do take one in
one‚Äôs weak moments, in the dead of night. Never-
theless, the experience had apparently proved sedative.
He had slept like an infant.</p>
<p>The morning found him vivacious with curiosity.</p>
<p>248 OUTOFTHEDEEP</p>
<p>He had paused to make only an exceedingly negli-
gent toilet before beginning his usual wanderings
about the house. Calm cold daylight reflection may
dismiss almost any nocturnal experience as a dream,
if, at any rate, one‚Äôs temperature in the night hours
is habitually above the norm. But Jimmie could not,
or would not, absolutely make up his mind. So clear
a picture had his visitant imprinted on his memory
that he even found himself (just like a specialist
soimding a patient in search of the secret ravages of
phthisis)‚Äî he had even fomd himself stealthily tap-
ping over the basement walls ‚Äî as if in search of a
concealed pantry I A foolish proceeding if one has
not the least desire in the world to attract the atten-
tion of one‚Äôs neighbours.</p>
<p>Having at length satisfied himself in a rather con-
fused fashion that whatever understudy of Soames
might share the house with him in the small hours,
he must be a butler of the migratory order. Jimmie
then began experimenting with the bells. Mounted on
a kitchen chair, cornice brush in hand, he had been
surprised by Mrs, Thripps, in her quiet boots, as he
stood gently knocking one by one the full eighteen
of the long greened crooked jingle row which hung
open-mouthed above the immense dresser.</p>
<p>She had caught him in the act, and Jimmie had
once more exercised his customary glib presence of
mind.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey ought to be hung in a scale, you know.
Oughtn‚Äôt they, Mrs. Thripps ? Then we could have
‚ÄòHome, sweet Home 1‚Äô and a hunting up and a hun-
ting down, grandsires and treble bems, and a grand</p>
<p>OUT OF THE DEEP 249</p>
<p>maximus, even on week days. And if we were in dan-
ger of any kind of fire ‚Äî which, joh will never be, we
could ring them backwards. Couldn‚Äôt we, Mrs.
Thripps ? Not that there‚Äôs much quality in them ‚Äî
no medieval monkish tone or timbre in them. They‚Äôre
a bit mouldy, too, and one can‚Äôt tell t‚Äôother from
which. Not like St. Faiths‚Äôs 1 One would recognise
that old danker in one‚Äôs shroud, wouldn‚Äôt one, Mrs.
Thripps ? Has it ever occurred to you that the first
campanologist‚Äôs real intention was not so much to
call the congregation, as to summon ‚Äî well ‚Äî what
the congregation‚Äôs after ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù Mrs. Thripps had agreed, her watery
grey eyes fixed largely on the elevated young man.
‚ÄúBut it don‚Äôt matter which of them you ring ; I‚Äôll
answer banj ‚Äî at least while I‚Äôm in the house. I don‚Äôt
think, sir, you rest your mind enough. My own boy,
now : he‚Äôs in the Navy . . . .‚Äù</p>
<p>But with one graceful flourish Jimmie had run his
long-handled brush clean East to West along the
Hanging row. ‚ÄúYou mustn‚Äôt,‚Äù he shouted, ‚Äúyou
shouldn‚Äôt. Once aboard the lugger, they are free I It‚Äôs
you mothers . . . .‚Äù He gently shook his peculiar wand
at the flat-looking little old woman. ‚ÄúNo, Mrs.
Thripps; what I‚Äôm after is he whols here, here! couchant,
perdu^ laired, in these same subterranean vaults when
you and I are snug in our nightcaps. A most nice-
spoken yoxmg man ! Not in the Navy, Mrs. Thripps!‚Äù</p>
<p>And before the old lady had had time to seize
any one of these seductive threads of conversation,
Jimmie had flashed his usual brilliant smile or grim-
ace at her, and soon afterwards sallied out of the</p>
<p>2JO OUT OF THE DEEP</p>
<p>house to purchase a further gross or two of
candles.</p>
<p>Gently and furtively pushing across the counter
half a sovereign ‚Äî ^not as a douceur, but merely as
from friend to friend ‚Äî he had similarly smiled back
at the secretive-looking old assistant in the staid
West End family-grocer‚Äôs.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo, I didn‚Äôt suppose you could remember me.
One alters. One ages. One deals elsewhere. But any-
how, a Happy New Year to you ‚Äî if the next ever
comes, you know.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou see, sir,‚Äù the straight-aproned old man had
retorted with equal confidentiality, ‚Äúit is not so much
the alterations. They are what you might call un-cir-
cum-ventible, sir. It‚Äôs the stream, sir. Behind the
counter here, we are like rocks in it. But even if I
can‚Äôt for the moment put a thought to your face ‚Äî
though it‚Äôs already stirring in me in a manner of
speaking, I shall in the future, sir. You may rely upon
that And the same, sir, to you ; and many of them.
I‚Äôm sure.‚Äù</p>
<p>Somehow or other Jimmie‚Äôs vanity had been molli-
fied by this pleasing little ceremoniousness ; and that
even before he had smiled yet once again at the saff-
ron yoimg lady in the Pay Box.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe truth is, my dear,‚Äù he had assured himself,
as he once more ascended into the dingy porch, ‚Äúthe
truth is when once you begin to tamper, you won‚Äôt
know where you are. You won‚Äôt, really.‚Äù</p>
<p>And that night he had lain soberly on, in a peculiar
state of physical quiescence and self-satisfaction, his
dark bright eyes wandering from nymph to nymph.</p>
<p>OUT OF THE DEEP 25I</p>
<p>his hands folded over his breast under the bedclothes,
his heart persisting in its usual habits. Nevertheless,
the fountain of his thoughts had continued softly to
plash on in its worn basin. With ears a-cock, he
had frankly enjoyed inhaling the patched, spent,
brilliant air.</p>
<p>And when his fingers had at last manifested the
faintest possible itch to experiment once more with
the bell-pull, he had slipped out of bed, and hastily
searching through a little privy case of his uncle‚Äôs
bedside books, had presently slipped back again,
armed with a fat little copy of ‚ÄúThe Mysteries of
Paris,‚Äù in its original French.</p>
<p>The next day a horrible lassitude descended upon
him. For the better part of an hour he had stood
staring out of the drawing-room window into the
London street. At last, with a yawn that was almost
a groan, and with an absurdly disproportionate effort,
he turned himself about. Heavily hung the gilded
chandeliers in the long vista of the room ; heavily
gloomed the gilded furniture. Scarcely distinguish-
able in the obscurity of the further wall stood watch-
ing him from a mirror what might have appeared to
be the shadowy reflection of himself. With a still, yet
extreme aversion he kept his eyes fixed bn this dis-
tant nonentity, hardly realising his own fantastic
resolve that if he did catch the least faint independent
movement there, he wotild give Soames Junior a
caustic piece of his mind. . . .</p>
<p>He must have been abominably fast asleep for
hours when, a night or two afterwards, he had sud-
cfenly awakened, sweat streaming along his body, his</p>
<p>Z^Z OUT OF THE DEEP</p>
<p>mou^ Stretched to a long narrow O, and his ri^ht
hand clutching the bell-rope, as might a drownmg
man at a straw.</p>
<dl>
<dt>The room was adrowse with light. All was still.</dt>
<dt>The flitting horrors between dream and wake m his</dt>
<dt>mind were already thinning into air. Through their</dt>
<dt>transparency he looked out once more on the sub-</dt>
<dt>stantial, the familiar. His breath came heavily, like</dt>
<dt>puffs of wind over a stormy sea, and yet a profound</dt>
<dt>jeace and tranquillity was swathing him in. The re-</dt>
<dd>axed mouth was now faintly smiling. Not a sound,
not the feeblest distant unintended tinkling was trem-
bling up from the abyss. And for a moment or two
the young man refrained even from turning his head
at the soundless opening and closing of the door.</dd>
</dl>
<p>He lay fully conscious that he was not alone ; that
quiet eyes had him steadily in regard. But, like rats,
his wits were beginning to busy themselves again.
Sheet relief from the terrors of sleep, shame of his
extremity and weakness, a festering sense of humili-
ation ‚Äî yes, he must save his face at all costs. He
must put this preposterous spying valet in his place.
Oddly enough, too, out of the deeps a peculiar little
vision of recollection had inexplicably obtruded itself
into consciousness. It would be a witticism of the first
water.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey are dreadfully out of season, you know,‚Äù he
began murmuring aflectedly into the hush, ‚Äúdread
fully. But what I‚Äôm really pining for is a bundl of</p>
<p>primroses A primrose by the rivet‚Äôs brim &hellip;.</p>
<p>must be a little conservative.‚Äù His voice was once
more trailing oS into a maudlin drowsiness. With an</p>
<p>OUT OF THE DEEP 253</p>
<p>efiFort he roused himself, and now with an extremely
sharp twist of his head, he turned to confront his
visitor.</p>
<p>But the room &lsquo;was already vacant, the door ajar,
and Jimmie‚Äôs lids were on the point of closing again,
sliding down over his tired eyes like leaden shutters
which no power on earth could hinder or restrain,
when at the faintest far whisper of sound they swept
back suddenly ‚Äî and almost incredibly wide ‚Äî to
drink in all they could of the spectacle of a small odd-
looking child who at that moment had embodied her-
self in the doorway.</p>
<p>She seemed to have not the least intention of re-
turning the compliment. Her whole gaze, from out of
her fair flaxen-pigtailed face, was fixed on the coarse
blue-banded kitchen bowl which she was carrying
with extreme care and caution in her two narrow
hands. The idiots down below had evidently filled it
too full of water, for the pale wide-petalled flowers
and thick crinkled leaves it contained were floating
buoyantly nid-nod to and fro as she moved ‚Äî pushing
on each slippered foot in turn in front of the other,
her whole mind concentrated on her task.</p>
<p>A plain child, but extraordinarily fair, as fair as the</p>
<p>E rimroses themsleves in the congregation of candle-
ght that motionlessly flooded the room ‚Äî a narrow-
chested long-chinned little creature who had evidently
outgrown her strength. Jimmie was well accustomed
to take things as they come ; and his brief sojourn in
his uncle‚Äôs house in his present state of health had
already enlarged the confines of the term ‚Äúthings.‚Äù
Anyhow, she was a relief from the Valet.</p>
<p>254 OUT OF THE DEEP</p>
<p>‚ñ† He found himself, then, watching this new visitor
without the least trace of astonishment or even of
surprise. And as his dark eyes coursed over the child,
he simply couldn‚Äôt decide whether ‚Äô she most closely
‚Äútook after‚Äù Soames Junior or Mrs. Thripps. All he
could positively assure himself of was just the look,
‚Äúthe family likeness.‚Äù And that in itself was a queerish
coincidence, since whatever your views might be re-
garding Soames Junior, Mrs. Thripps was real enough
‚Äî as real, at any rate, as her scrubbing-brush and her
wholesome evU-smelling soap.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Jimmie was taking a very tight
hold of himself. His mind might fancifully be com-
pared to a quiet green swarming valley between steep
rock-bound hills in which a violent battle was pro-
ceeding ‚Äî standards and horsemen and smoke and
terror and violence ‚Äî but no sound.</p>
<p>Deep down somewhere he really wanted to be
‚Äúnice‚Äù to the child. She meant no ill ; she was a de-
mure far-away harmless-looking creature. Ages
ago . . . On the other hand he wished to heaven
they would leave him alone. They were pestering
him. He knew perfectly well how far he was gone,
and bitterly resented this renewed interference. And
if there was one thing he detested, it was being made
to look silly ‚Äî ‚ÄúI hope you are trying to be a good
little boy ? &hellip; You have not been talking to the
servants That kind of thing.</p>
<p>It was, therefore, with mixed feelings and with a
tinge of shame-facedness that he heard his own sneer-
ing toneless voice insinuate itself into the silence ;
‚ÄúAnd what, missikins, can I do for you ? . . , W&rsquo;kfft '</p>
<p>OUT OF THE DEEP 255</p>
<p>you will understand ; not Hojp ?‚Äù The sneer had
degenerated into a snarl.</p>
<p>The child at this had not perceptibly faltered.
Her face had seemed to lengthen a little, but that
might have been due solely to her efforts to deliver
her bowl without spilling its contents. Indeed she
actually succeeded in so doing, almost before Jimmie
had time to withdraw abruptly from the little gilt-
railed table on which she deposited the clumsy pot.
Frock, pigtail, red hands ‚Äî she seemed to be as ‚Äúreal‚Äù
a fellow creature as you might wish to see. But Jim-
mie stared quiz2ically on. Unfortunately primroses
have no scent, so that he could not call on his nose to
bear witness to his eyes. And the congested conflict
in the green valley was stiU proceeding.</p>
<p>The child had paused. Her hands hung down now
as if they were accustomed to service ; and her pale
blue eyes were fixed on his face in that exasperating
manner which suggests that the owner of them is
otherwise engaged. Not that she was looking through
him. Even the sharpest of his ‚Äúfemale friends‚Äù had
never been able to boast of that little accomplishment.
She was looking into him ; and as if he occupied time
rather than space. Or was she, sneered that weary in-
ward voice again, was she merely waiting for a tip ?</p>
<p>‚ÄúLook here,‚Äù said Jimmie,dexterously raising him-
self to his elbow on the immense lace-fringed pillow,
‚Äúit‚Äôs all very well ; you have managed things quite
admirably, considering your age and the season, and
so on. But I didn‚Äôt ask for primroses, I asked for vio-
lets. That‚Äôs very old trick ‚Äî ^very old trick.‚Äù</p>
<p>For one further instant, dark and fair, crafty and</p>
<p>2j6 - OUT OF THE DEEP</p>
<p>simpleton face communed, each with each. But the
smile on the one had fainted into a profound child-
like. contemplation. And then, so swift and imper-
ceptible had been his visitant‚Äôs envanishment out of
the room, that the very space she had occupied
seemed to remain for a while outlined in the air ‚Äî a
nebulous shell of vacancy. She must, apparently, have
glided backwards through the doorway, for Jimmie
had assuredly not been conscious of the remotest
glimpse of her pigtail from behind.</p>
<p>Instantly on that, the f^tonv hillside within had
resounded with a furious clangour ‚Äî cries and shouts
and screamings ‚Äî and Jimmie, his face bloodless with
rage, his eyes almost blind with it, had leapt out of
the great bed as if in murderous pursuit. There must,
however, have been an unusual degree or so of fever
in his veins that night so swift was his reaction. For
the moment he was on his feet an almost unendurable
self-pity had swept into possession of him. To take a
poor devil as literally as that I To catch him off his
guard ; not to give him the mere fleck of an oppor-
tunity to get his balance, to explain, to answer back I
Curse the primroses.</p>
<p>But there was no time to lose.</p>
<p>With one hand clutching his pyjamas, the other
carrying the bowl, he poked forward out of the flare
of the room into the cold hghtlessness of the wide
stone staircase.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLook here,‚Äù he called down in alow argumentative
voice,‚Äúlook here, Youl You can cheat and you can
dieat, but to half strangle a fellow in his sleep, and
then send him up the snufBing caretaker‚Äôs daughter ‚Äî</p>
<p>OUT OP THE DEEP 257</p>
<p>No, No &hellip;. Next time, you old makebelieve,
we‚Äôd prefer company a little more ‚Äî a little more
congeniaV&rsquo;</p>
<p>He swayed slightly, grimacing vacantly into the
darkness, and listening to his speech as dimly as
might a somnambulist to the distant roar of falling
water. And then, poor benighted creature, Jimmie
tried to spit, but his lips and tongue were dry, and
that particular insult was spared him.</p>
<p>He had stooped laboriously, had put down the
earthenware bowl on the Persian mat at the head of
the staircase, and was self-congratulatorily re-wel-
coming himself into the scene of still lustre he had
dared for that protracted minute to abandon, when
he heard as if from beneath and behind him a kind of
lolloping disquietude and the sound as of a clumsy-
clawed, but persistent animal pushing its uncustom-
ary awkward way up the soap-polished marble stair-
case.</p>
<p>It was to be tit for tat, then. The miserable manage
had let loose its menagerie. That. They were going
to experiment with the mouse-cupboard-and-keyhole
trickery of his childhood. Jimmie was violently shiv-
ering ; his very toes were clinging to the mat on
which he stood.</p>
<p>Swaying a little, and casting at the same time a
strained whitened glance round the room in which
every object rested in the light as if so it had rested
from all eternity, he stood mutely and ghastly list-
ening.</p>
<p>Even a large bedroom, five times the size of a small
boy‚Äôs attic, affords little scope for a fugitive, and</p>
<p>258 OUT OF THE DEEP</p>
<p>shutting your eyes, darkening your outward face, is
no escape. It had been a silly boast, he agreed ‚Äî that
challenge, that ‚Äúdare‚Äù on the staircase ; die boast of
an idiot. For the ‚Äúcongenial company‚Äù that had now
managed to hoof and scrabble its way up the sUppery
marble staircase was already on the threshold.</p>
<p>All was utterly silent now. There was no obvious
manifestation of danger. What was peering steadily
in upon him out of the obscurity beyond the door,
was merely a blurred whitish beast-like shape With
still, passive, almost stagnant eyes in its immense
fixed face. A perfectly ludicrous object ‚Äî on paper.
Yet a creature so nauseous to soul and body, and with
so obscene a greed in its motionless piglike grin that
with one vertiginous swirl Jimmie‚Äôs candles had
swept up in his hand like a lateral race of streaming
planets into outer darkness.</p>
<p>If his wet groping fingers had not then encountered
one of the carved pedestals of his uncle‚Äôs bedstead,
Jimmie would have fallen ; Jimmie would have found
in fact, the thing‚Äôs physical level.</p>
<p>Try as he might, he had never in the days tlaat fol-
lowed made quite cleat in his mind why for the third
time he had not made a desperate plunging clutch at
the bell rope. The thing must Iwve been Soames
Junior‚Äôs emissary, even if the bird-faced scullerv maid
with the primroses had not also been one of the ‚Äústaff.‚Äù</p>
<p>That he had desisted simply in case she should her-
self have answered his summons and so have encdun-
tered the spurious animal as she mounted the dark
staircase seemed literally too ‚Äúgood‚Äù to be true. Not</p>
<p>OUT OF THE DEEP</p>
<p>259</p>
<p>only was Jimmie no sentimentalist, but that particular
kind of goodness, even in a state of mind perfectly
calm and collected, was not one of his pleasanter
characteristics.</p>
<p>Yet facts are facts ‚Äî even comforting ones. And
unless his memory was utterly untrustworthy, he had
somehow ‚Äî somehow contrived to regain his physical
balance. Candelabrum in hand, he had actually, indeed,
at last emerged from the room, and stooped his dark
head over the balusters in search of what unaccoun-
tably had not awaited his nearer acquaintance. And he
had ‚Äî he must have ‚Äî flung the substantial little blue-
banded slop-basin, primroses and all, clean straight
down in the direction of any kind of sentient target
that happened to be in its way.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou must understand, Mrs. Thripps,‚Äù he had
afterwards solemnly explained, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care to be
disturbed, and particularly at night. All litter should,
of course, be immediately cleared away. That‚Äôs merely
as things go in a well-regulated household, as, in fact,
they do go. And I see you have replaced the one or
two little specimens I was looking over out of the
cabinet on the staircase. Pretty things, too ; though
you hadn‚Äôt the advantage of being in the service of
their late owner ‚Äî ^my uncle. As I was. Of course,
too, breakages cannot be avoided. There, I assure
wu, you are absolutely free. Moth and rust, Mrs.
llitipps. No; all that I was merely enquiring about
at the moment is that particular pot. There was an
accident last night ‚Äî ^primroses and so on. And one
might have expected, one might almost have sworn,
Mte, Thripps, that at least a shard or two, as the</p>
<p>l6o OUT OF THE DEEP</p>
<p>Psalmist says, would have been pretty conspicuous
even if the water bad completely dried away. Not that
I heard the smash, mind. I don‚Äôt go so far as that.
Nor am I making any insinuations whatever. You are
the best of good creatures, you are indeed ‚Äî and it* s
no good looking at me like Patience on a monument ;
because at present life is real and life is earnest. All I
mean is that if one for a single moment ceases to
guide one‚Äôs conduct on reasonable lines ‚Äî well, one
comes a perfectly indescribable cropper, Mrs. Thripps.
Like the pot.‚Äù</p>
<p>Mrs. Thripps‚Äôs grey untidy head had remained
oddly stuck out from her body throughout this har-
angue. ‚ÄúNo, sir,‚Äù she repeated once more.&rdquo; High and
low I‚Äôve searched the house down, and there isn‚Äôt a
shadder of what you might be referring to, not a
shadder. And once more, I ask you, sir ; let me call
in Dr. Stokes. He‚Äôs a very nice gentleman ; and one
as keeps what should be kept as close to himself as it
being his duty he sees right and proper to do. Chasing
and racketing of yourself up and down these tuns of
luked stairs ‚Äî in the dead of night ‚Äî is no proper
place for you, sir, inyour state. And I don‚Äôt like to
take the responsibility. It‚Äôs first the candles, then the
bells, and then the kitching, and then the bason ; I
know what I‚Äôm talking about, sir, having lost two,
and one at sea.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd suppose, my dear,‚Äù Jimmie had almost as
brilliantly as ever smiled ; ‚Äúsuppose we are aU of us
‚Äòat sea.‚Äô What then ?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy tiien, sir,‚Äù Mrs. Thripps had courageously
retorted, ‚ÄúFd as lief be at the bottom of it. fere‚Äôs</p>
<p>OUTOFTHEDEEP z6l</p>
<p>been as much wotty and trouble and making two
ends meet in mj life not to make the getting out of it
what you‚Äôd stand on no ceremony for. I say it with all
decent respect for what‚Äôs respectful and proper, sir ;
but there isn‚Äôt a morning I step down those area steps
but my heart‚Äôs in my mouth for fear there won‚Äôt be
anything in the house but what can‚Äôt answer back.
It‚Äôs been a struggle to keep on, sir ; and you as gener-
ous a gentleman as need be, if only you‚Äôd remain
warm and natural in your bed when once there.‚Äù</p>
<p>A little inward trickle of laughter had entertained
Jimmie as he watched the shapeless patient old mouth
utter these last few words.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just it, Mrs. Thripps,‚Äù he had replied
softly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve done for me far more effectively than
anyone I care to remember in my insignificant little
lifetime. You have indeed.‚Äù Jimmie had even touched
the hand bent like the claw of a bird around the broom-
handle. ‚ÄúIn fact, you know ‚Äî and I‚Äôm bound to con-
fess it as gratefully as need be ‚Äî they are a// of them
doing for me as fast as they can. I don‚Äôt complain, not
the least little bit in the world. All that I might be
asking is. How the devil ‚Äî to put it politely ‚Äî how the
goodness gracious is one to tell which is which ? In my
particular case, it seems to be the miller that sets the
wind ; not, of course, that he‚Äôs got any particular
grain to grind. Not even wild oats, you funny old
mother of a youthful mariner. No, no, no. Even the
fact that there wasn‚Äôt perhaps any pot after all, you
will understand, doesn‚Äôt positively prove that neither
cotdd there have been any primroses. And before next
Janu^‚Äôsfour months old we shall be at the end of yet</p>
<p>262 OUT OF THE DEEP</p>
<p>another April. At least and a sort of almost</p>
<p>bluish pallor had spread like a shadow over his
face ‚Äî ‚Äúat least you will be. All of which is only
to say, dear Madam, as Beaconsfield remarked to Old
Vic., that I am thanking you wojf.‚Äù</p>
<p>At which Mrs. Thripps immediately fell upon her
knees on her housemaid‚Äôs pad and plunged her hands
into her zinc pail ‚Äî only instantly after to sit back on
her heels, ski^y hands on canvas apron. ‚ÄúAll I says,
sit, is. We go as we go ; and a nicer gentleman, taking
things on the surface, I never worked for. But one
don‚Äôt want to move too much m the Public Hcye, sir.
Of all the houses below stairs I‚Äôve worked for and
all alone in I don‚Äôt want to charnst on a more private
in a manner of speaking than this. All that I was
saying, sir, and I wouldn‚Äôt to none but you, is the
life‚Äôs getting on my nerves. When that door there
closes after me, and every day drawing out steady
as you can see without so much as glancing at the
clock ‚Äî I say, to myself, Well, better that pore young
gentleman alone up there at night, cough and al^
than me, I wouldn‚Äôt sleep in this house, sir, not if
you was to offer me a plateful of sovereigns. . .
Unless, sir, you wanted me.‚Äù</p>
<p>On reflection Jimmie decided that he had cut al-
most a gallant figure as he had retorted gaily ‚Äî yet
with extraordinary sobriety; ‚Äî ‚ÄúYou sh^ have a
whole dishful before I‚Äôm done, Mrs. Thripps ‚Äî
with a big scoop in it for the gravy. But on my oath,
I assure you there‚Äôs absolutely nothing or nobody in
this old bam of a mu scum except you and me. N obody,
unless, of course, you will understand, one happens</p>
<p>OUT OF THE DEEP 26}</p>
<p>to pull the bell. And that we‚Äôte not likely to do in
broad daylight. Ate we, Mrs. Thripps ?‚Äù Upon which
he had hastily caught up his aunt‚Äôs handbag and had
emerged into a daylight a good deal bleaker if not
broader than he could gratefully stomach.</p>
<p>For a while Jimmie had let well alone. Indeed, if it
had been a mere matter of choice, he would far rather
have engaged in a friendly and jocular conversation
of this description with his old charwoman than in
the endless monologues in which he found himself
submerged on other occasions. One later afternoon,
for instance, at half-past three by his watch, sit-
ting there by a small fire in the large muffled
drawing room, he at length came definitely to the con-
clusion that some kind of finality should be reached
in his relations with the Night Staff in his Uncle
Timothy‚Äôs.</p>
<p>It was pretty certain that h&rsquo;s visit would soon be
drawing to a close. Staying out at night until he
was almost too exhausted to climb down to the
pavement from his hansom ‚Äî the first April silver of
dawn wanning the stark and empty chinmey-pots ‚Äî
had proved a dull and tedious alternative. The mere
spectator of gaiety, he concluded, as he stared at the
immense picture of the Colosseum on his Uncle Tim-
othy‚Äôs ww, may have as boring a time as must the
slaves who cleaned out the cages of the lions that ate
the Christians. And snapping out insults at former
old cronies who couldn‚Äôt help their faces being as
tiresome as a whitewashed pigsty had soon grown
wearisome.</p>
<p>264 OUT OF THE DEEP</p>
<p>Jimmie, of course, was accustomed to taking no
interest in things which did not interest him ; but
quite respectable people could manage that equally
well. What fretted him almost beyond endurance was
an increasing inability to keep his attention fixed on
what was really what at least all such respectable
people, one rhight suppose, would unanimously agree
was there.</p>
<p>A moment‚Äôs fixture of the eyes ‚Äî and he would
find himself steadily, steadily listening, now in, a
creeping dread that somewhere, down below, there
was a good deal that needed an almost constant atten-
tion, and now in sudden alarm that, after all, there
was absolutely nothing. Again and again in recollec-
tion he had hung over the unlighted staircase listen-
ing in an extremity of foreboding for the outbreak of
a rabbit-like childish squeal of terror which would
have proved ‚Äî well, wiaf would it have proved ? My
God, what a world ! You can prove no^ng.</p>
<p>The fact that he was all but certain that any such
intolerably helpless squeal never AaJ wailed up to him
out of its pit of blackness could be only a partial con-
solation, He hadn‚Äôt meant to be a beast. It was only
his facetious little way. And you would have to be
something pretty piggish in pigs to betray a child ‚Äî
however insubstantial‚Äî into the nausea and vertigo
he had experienced in the presence of that unspeak-
able abortion. The whole thing had become a fatuous
obsession. If, it appeared, you only remained solitary
and secluded enough, and let your mind wander on in
its own sweet way, the problem was almost bound to
become, if not your one and only, at least your chief</p>
<p>OUT OF THE DEEP 265</p>
<p>concern. Unless you were pretcrnaturally busy and
preoccupied, you simply couldn^t live on and on in
a haunted house without being occasionally reminded
of its ghosts.</p>
<p>To dismiss the matter as pure illusion ‚Äî the spec-
tral picturing of life‚Äôs fitful fever ‚Äî might be all very
well ; that is if you had the blood of a fish. But who
on earth had ever found the world the pleasanter and
sweeter a place to bid good-bye to simply because it
was obviously ‚Äúsubstantial,‚Äù whatever that might
mean ? Simply because it did nothing you wanted it
to do unless you paid for it pretty handsomely ; or
unless you accepted what it proffered with as open a
hospitality as Jimmie had bestowed on his pilgrims
of the night. Not that he much wanted ‚Äî however
pressing the invitation ‚Äî to wander off out of his body
into a better world, or, for that matter, into a worse.</p>
<p>Upstairs under the roof years ago Jimmie as a
small boy would rather have died of terror than
meddle with the cord above his bed-rail ‚Äî simply be-
cause he knew that Soames Senior was at the other
end of it. He had hated Soames ; he had merely feared
the nothings of his night hours. But, suppose
Soames had been a different kind of buder. There
must be almost as many kinds as there are human
beings. Suppose his Uncle Timothy and Aunt Char-
lotte had chosen theirs a litde less idiosyncratically ;
what then ?</p>
<p>Well, anyhow, in a sense, he was not sorry life had
been a little excidng these last few weeks. How odd
that what all but jellied your soul in your body at
night or in a dream, might merely amuse you like a</p>
<p>266 OUT OF THE DEEP</p>
<p>shilling shocker in the safety of day. The safety of
day ‚Äî at the very cadence of the words in his mind,
as he sat there in his aunt‚Äôs ‚Äúsalon,‚Äù his limbs huddled
over Mrs. Thtipps‚Äôs fire, Jimmie‚Äôs eyes had fixed
themselves again. Again he was listening. Was it that,
if y6u saw ‚Äúin your mind‚Äù any distant room of place,
that place must actually at the moment contain you
‚Äî some self, some ‚Äúastral body ?‚Äù If so, wouldn‚Äôt, of
course, you bear yourself moving about in it ?</p>
<p>There was a sKght whining wind in the street out-
side the rainy window that afternoon, and once more
the bright idea crossed Jimmie‚Äôs mind that he should
steal upstairs before it was dark, mount up on to the
Arabian bed and just cut the beU-puU ‚Äî once for aU.
But would that necessarily dismiss the Staff? Neces-
sarily ? His eye wandered to the discreet S of yet an-
other bell-pull ‚Äî that which graced the wall beneath
the expansive white marble chimney-piece.</p>
<p>He hesitated. There was no doubt his mind was
now hopelessly jaundiced against all bell-ropes ‚Äî
whether they failed to summon one to church or per-
sisted in summoning one to a six-foot hole in a ceme-
tery. His Uncle Timothy lay in a Mausoleum. On the
other hand he was properly convinced that a gentle-
man is as a gendeman does, and that it was really ‚Äúup to
you‚Äù to treat all bell-answerers with decent courtesy.
No matter who, when, where. A universal rule hke
that is a sheer godsend. If they didn‚Äôt answer, well,
you couldn‚Äôt he^ yourself. Or rather, you would have
to.</p>
<p>This shivering was merely physical. When a fellow
is so thin that he can almost heat his ribs grid one</p>
<p>OUT OF THE DEEP 267</p>
<p>against the othet when he stoops to pick up a poker,
such symptoms must be expected. TTiere was still an
hour or two of daylight ‚Äî even though clouds ad-
mitted only a greyish light upon the world, and his
Uncle Timothy‚Äôs house was by nature friendly to
gloom. That house at this moment seemed to hang
domed upon his shovJders like an immense impond-
erable shell. The flames in the chimney whispered,
fluttered, hovered, like fitfully-playing, once-happy
birds.</p>
<p>Supposing if, even against his better judgment, he
leaned forward now in his chair and ‚Äî what was in-
finitely more conventional and in a sense more proper
than summoning unforseen entities to one‚Äôs bedside
‚Äî supposing he gave just one discreet little tug at that
small porcelain knob ; what would he ask for ? He
need ask nothing. He could act. Yes, if he could be
perfectly sure that some monstrous porcine caco-
demon akin to the shapes of childish nightmare
would come hoofing up out of the deeps at his behest
‚Äî well, he would chance it. He would have it out
with the brute. It was stiU day.</p>
<p>It was still day. But, maybe, the car of pleasanter
visitors might catch the muffled tinkle ? In the young
man‚Äôs mind there was now no vestige of jocularity.
In an instant‚Äôs lightness of heart he had once thought
of purchasing from the stifF-aproned old assistant at
his Aunt Charlotte‚Äôs family grocer‚Äôs, a thumping big
box of Chocolates. Why, just that one small bowl in
famijle rose up there could be bartered for the pretti-
est little necldet of seed pearls. She had done her best
‚Äî ^with her skimpy shoulders, skimpier pigtail and</p>
<p>268 OUT OF THE DEEP</p>
<p>soda-reddened hands. Pigtail ! But no ; you might pull
real beUs : to pull dubiously genuine pigtails seemed
now a feeble jest. The old Jimmie of that kindoffacc-
tiousness was a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Apart from pigs and tweeny-maids, what other
peculiar emanations might in the future respond to
his summonings, Jimmie‚Äôs exhausted imagination
could only faindy prefigure. For a few minutes a mod-
ern St. Anthony sat there in solitude in the vast half-
blinded London drawing-room ; while shapes and
images and apparitions of memory and fantasy sprang
into thin being and passed away in his mind. No, no.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do to the Book ; quench the candles ;</p>
<p>Ring the bell. Amen, Amen‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Äî ^he was done with all that. Maledictions and ana-
themas ; they only tangled the hank.</p>
<p>So when at last ‚Äî his meagre stooping body mutely
played on by the flamelight ‚Äî he jerked round his dark
narrow head to glance at the distant mirror, it must
have been on the mere after-image, so to speak, of
the once quite substantial-looking tweeny-maid that
his exhausted eyes thirstily fixed themselves.</p>
<p>She was there ‚Äî over there, where Soames Junior
had more than once taken up his obsequious station.
She was smiling ‚Äî if the dusk of the room could be
trusted that far; and not through, butreally^/ Jimmie.
She was fairer than ever, fairer than the flaxcncst of
nymphs on his uncle‚Äôs ceiling, fairer than the saffron-
cst of young ladies in the respcctablest of family gro-
cers, fairer even then</p>
<p>Jimmie hung on this simple vision as did Dives on
dae spccucle of Lazarus in bliss. At once, of course,</p>
<p>OUT OF THE DEEP 269</p>
<p>after his very first sigh of relief and welcome, he had
turned back on his lips a glib little speech suggesting
forgiveness ‚Äî Let auld acquaintance be forgot ; that
kind of thing. He was too tired even to be clever
now. And the oddest of convictions had at once come
into his mind ‚Äî seemed almost to fill his body even
‚Äî that she was waiting for something else. Yes, she
was smiling as if in hope. She was waiting to be told
to go. Jimmie was no father. He didn‚Äôt want to be
considerate to the raw little creature, to cling to her
company for but a few minutes longer, with a view
to returns in kind. No, nothing of all that. ‚ÄúOh, my
God ; my God 1‚Äù a voice groaned within him, but
not at any unprecedented jag or stab of pain.</p>
<p>The child was still waiting. Quite quiedy there ‚Äî as
if a shadow, as if a secret and obscure ray of light. And
it seemed to Jimmie that in its patient face hung veil
upon veil of uncountable faces of the past ‚Äî in paint,
stone, actuality, dream ‚Äî that he had glanced at or
brooded on in the enormous history of his Ufe.
That he may have coveted, too. And as well as his
rebellious features could and would, he smiled back
at her.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI understand, my dear,‚Äù he drew back his dry lips to
explain. ‚ÄúPerfeedy. And it was courtesy itself of you
to look in when I didn‚Äôt ring. I didn&rsquo;t. I absolutely put
my tongue out at the grinning old knob. . . But no
more of that. One mustn‚Äôt talk for talking‚Äôs sake.
Else, why ail those old Trappists . . . though none
of ‚Äôem such a bag-of-bones as me, I bet. But without
jesting, you know. . .‚Äù</p>
<p>Once more a distant voice within spoke in Jithmie‚Äôs</p>
<p>ijo OUT OF THE DEEP</p>
<p>cat. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impoxtant‚Äù; it said. ‚ÄúYou really must
hold your tongue‚Äî until, well, it holds itself.‚Äù But
Jimmie‚Äôs face continued to smile.</p>
<p>And then suddenly, every vestige of amusem^t
abandoned it. He stared baldly almost emptily at the
faint inmate of his solitude. ‚ÄúAll that I have to say,‚Äù
he muttered, ‚Äúis just this : ‚Äî have Mrs. Thripps. I
haven‚Äôt absolutely cut the wire. 1 wish to be alone.
But if I ring. I‚Äôm not askings do you see ? In time I
may be able to know what I want. But what is im-
portant now is that no mv/te ihan that accursed Pig
were your primroses ‚Äòreal,‚Äô my dear. You see things
must be real. And now, I suppose,‚Äù he had begun
shivering again, ‚Äúyou must go to ‚Äî you must go.
But listen ! usten ! we part friends I‚Äù</p>
<p>The coals in the grate, with a scarcely audible
shuffling, recomposed themselves to their consuming.</p>
<p>When there hasn‚Äôt been anything there, nothing
can be said to have vanished from the place where it
has not been. Sdll, Jimmie had felt infinitely colder
and immeasurably lonelier when bis mouth had thus
fallen to silence ; and he was so empty and complete-
ly exhausted that his one apprehension had been lest
he should be unable to ascend the staircase to get to
bed. There was no doubt of it : his ultimatum had
been instantly effective. The whole house was now
preternaturally empty. It was needless even to listen
to prove that. So absolute was its pervasive quietude
that when at last he gathered his bones together in the
effortTo rise, to juoge from the withering colour of
the (Jlders and ashes in the fireplace, he must have</p>
<p>OUTOFTHEDEEP 27I</p>
<p>houts asleep ; and daybreak must be</p>
<p>^ V Hb fearriged the feat at last, gathered up the tartan
shawl that had tented in his scarecrow
&lsquo;imees, a;,;#! lit the only candle in its crystal stick in
his Aunt Charlotte‚Äôs drawing-room. And it was an
almost quixotically peaceful though forebodefui
Jimmie who, step by step, the fountain of his thoughts
completely stilled, his night-mind as clear and spark-
ling as a cavern bedangled with stalagmites and
stalactites, climbed laboriously on and up, from wide
shallow marble stair to stair.</p>
<p>He paused in the corridor above. But the nymphs
within ‚Äî Muses, Graces, Fates, what not ‚Äî piped in
vain their mute decoy. His Uncle Timothy‚Äôs Arabian
bed in vain summoned him to its downy embraces.
At the wide-open door he brandished his guttering
candle in a last smiling gesture of farewell ; and held
on.</p>
<p>That is why when, next morning, out of a sound-
ing slanting shower of rain Mrs. Thripps admitted
herself into the house at the area door, she found
the young man, still in his clothes, lying very fast
asleep indeed on the trucklebed in the attic. His
hands were&rsquo;not only crossed but convulsively clench-
ed in that position on his breast. And it appeared
from certain distressing indications that he must have
experienced a severe struggle to refrain from a wild
blind tug at the looped-up length of knotted whip-
cord over his head.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact it did not occur to the Jkered</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll OUT OF THE DEEP</p>
<p>old charwoman‚Äôs mind to speculate whetl^^^
Jimmie had actually made such a last a&rsquo;tcnir t. (M
‚ñ†whether he had been content merely to
Soames who might, perhaps, like all good
come when he was wanted rather than when lie
called. All her own small knowledge of Soameses,
though not without comfort, had been acquired at
second-hand.</p>
<p>Nor did Mrs. Thripps waste time in surmising
how Jimmie could ever have persuaded himsell to
loop up the cord like that out of his reach, unless he
had first become abysmally ill-content ‚ñ†with his small,
primitive, and belated knowledge of campanology.</p>
<p>She merely looked at what was left of him ; her
old face almost comically transfixed in its appearance
of pity, horror, astonishment, and curiosity.</p>
<p>THE CREATURES</p>
<p>I T was the ebbing light of evening that recalled me
out of my story to a consciousness of my where-
abouts. I dropped the squat little ted book to my
knee and glanced out of the narrow and begrimed
oblong window. We were skirting the eastern
coast of cliffs, to the very edge of which a plough-
man, stumbling along behind his two great horses,
was driving the last of bis dark furrows. Ln a cleft
far down between the rocks a cold and idle sea was
soundlessly laying its frigid garlands of foam. I
stated over the flat stretch of waters, then turned
my head, and looked with a kind of suddenness into
the face of my one fellow-traveller.</p>
<p>He had entered the carriage, all but unheeded, yet
not altogether unresented, at the last country station.
His features were a little obscure in the fading day-
light that hung between our four narrow walls, but
apparently his eyes had been fixed on my face for
some little time.</p>
<p>He narrowed his lids at this unexpefted confron-
tation, jerked back his head, and cast a glance out of
his mirky glass at the slip of greenish-bright moon
that was struggling into its fuU brilliance above the
dun, swelling uplands.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a queer experience, railway-travelling,‚Äù he
began abruptly, in a low, almost deprecating voice,
drawing his hand across Ws eyes. ‚ÄúOne is cast into
a passing privacy with a fellow-stranger and then is
gone.‚Äù It was as if he had been patiently awaiting
the attention of a chosen listener.</p>
<p>27 $ the creatores</p>
<p>and cheese in pocket, from the bate old house I
lodged in, bound for that unforeseen nowhere for
which the heart, the fantasy aches. Lingering hot
noondays would find me stretched in a state half-
comatose, yet vigilant, on the close-flowered turf of
the fields or cliffs, on the sun-baked sands and rocks,
soaking in the scene and life around me like some
pilgrim chameleon. It was in hope to lose my way
that I would set out. How shall a man find his way
unless he lose it ? Now and then I succeeded.
That country is large, and its land and sea marks
easily cheat the stranger. I was still of an age, you
see, when my ‚Äòsmall door‚Äô was ajar, and I planted
a solid foot to keep it from shutting. But how
could I know what I was after ? One just shakes
the tree of life, and the tare fruits come tumbling
down, to rot for the most part in the lush grasses.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat was most haunting and provocative in
that far-away country was its fleeting resemblance
to the count^ of dream. You stand, you sit, or lie
prone on its bud-starred heights, and look down ;
the green, dispersed, treeless landscape spreads
beneath you, with its hollows and mounded slopes,
clustering farmstead, and scatter of village, all
motionless under the vast wash of sun and blue,
like the drop-scene of some enchanted playhouse
centuries old. So, too, the visionary bird-haunted
headlands, veiled faintly in a mist of unreality above
their broken stones and the enormous saucer or the sea.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou cannot guess there what vou may not chance
upon, or whom. Bells clash, boom, and quarrel
hollowly on the edge of darkness in those breakers.</p>
<p>THE CREATURES 277</p>
<p>Voices waver across the fainter winds. The birds
cry in a tongue unknown yet not unfamiliar. The
sky is the hawks‚Äô and the stars‚Äô. There one is on the
edge of life, of the unforeseen, whereas our cities ‚Äî
are not our desiccated jaded minds ever continually
pressing and edging further and further away from
freedom, the vast unknown, the infinite presence,
picking a fool‚Äôs journey from sensual fact to fact
at the tail of that he-ass called Reason ? I suggest
that in that solitude the spirit within us realises
that it treads the outskirts of a region long since
called the Imagination. I assert we have strayed,
and in our blindness abandoned ‚Äù</p>
<p>My stranger paused in his frenay, glanced out at
me from his obscure corner as if he had intended to
stun, to astonish me with some violent heresy. We
puffed out slowly, laboriously, from a ‚ÄúHalt‚Äù at
which in the gathering dark and moonshine we had
for some while been at a standstill. Never was
wedding-guest more desperately at the mercy of
ancient mariner.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWell, one day,‚Äù he went on, lifting his voice a
little to master the resounding heart-beats of our
steam-engine ‚Äî ‚Äúone late afternoon, in my goal-less
wanderings, I had climbed to the summit of a steep
grass-grown cart-track, winding up dustily between
dense, untended hedges. Even then I might have
missed the house to which it led, for, hair-pin fashion,
the track here abruptly turned back on itself, and
only a far fainter footpath led on over the hill-crest.
I might, I say, have missed the house and ‚Äî and its</p>
<p>278 THE CREATURES</p>
<p>inmates, if I had not heard the musical sound of
what seemed like the twangling of a harp. This
thin-drawn, sweet, tuneless warbling welled over the
close green grass of the height as if out of space.
Truth cannot say whether it was of that ait or of my
own fantasy. Nor did I ever discover what instru-
ment, whether of man or Ariel, had released a
strain so pure and yet so bodiless.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI pushed on and found myself in command of a
gorse-strewn height, a stretch of country that lay
a few hundred paces across the steep and sudden
valley in between. In a V-shaped entry to the left,
and sunwards, lay an azure and lazy tongue of the
sea. And as my eye slid softly thence and upwards
and along the sharp, green horizon line against the
glass-clear turquoise of space, it caught the flinty
glitter of a square chimney. I pushed on, and
presently found myself at the gate of a farmyard.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere was but one straw-mow upon its staddlcs.
A few fowls were sunning themselves in their dust-
baths. White and pied doves preened and cooed
on the roof of an outbuilding as golden with its
lichens as if the western sun had scattered its dust for
centuries upon the large slate slabs. Just that life
and the whispering of tne wind : nothing more. Yet
even at one swift glimpse I seemed to have trespassed
upon a peace that had endured for ages ; to have
crossed the viewless border that divides time from
eternity. I leaned, resting, over the gate, and could
have remained there for hours, lapsmg ever more
profoundlv into the blessed quietude that had stolen
over my thoughts.</p>
<p>THE CREATURES 279</p>
<p>‚ÄúA bent-up woman appeared at the dark entry of a
stone shed opposite to me, and, shading her eyes,
paused in prolonged scrutiny of the stranger. At
that I entered the gate and, explaining that I had lost
my way and was tired and thirsty, asked for some
milk. She made no reply, but after peering up at
me, with something between suspicion and appre-
hension on her weather-beaten old face, led me
towards the house which lay to the left on the slope
of the valley, hidden from me till then by plumy
bushes of tamarisk.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt was a low grave house, grey-chimneyed, its
stone walls traversed by a deep shadow cast by the
declining sun, its dark windows rounded and unctir-
tained, its door wide open to the porch. She entered
the house, and I paused upon the threshold. A deep
unmoving quiet lay within, like that of water in a
cave renewed by the tide. Above a table hung a
wreath of wUd flowers. To the right was a heavy
oak settle upon the flags. A beam of sunlight
pierced the air of the staircase from an upper window.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPresently a dark long-faced gaunt man appeared
from within, contemplating me, as he advanced, out
of eyes that seemed not so much to fix the intruder as
to encircle his image, as the sea contains the distant
speck of a ship on its wide blue bosom of water.
They might have been the eyes of the blind ; the
windows of a house in dream to which the inmate
must make something of a pilgrimage to look out
upon actuality. Then he smiled, and the long,
dark features, melanchoW yet serene, took light upon
diem, as might a bluff of rock beneath a thin passing</p>
<p>28 o the creatures</p>
<p>wash of sunshine. With a gesture he welcomed me
into the large dark-flagged kitchen, cool as a cellar,
airy as a belfry, its sweet air traversed by a long
oblong of light out of the west.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe wide shelves of the painted dresser were
laden with crockery. A wreath of freshly-gathered
flowers hung over the chimney-piece. As we
entered, a twittering cloud of small birds, robins,
hedge-sparrows, chsiiffinches fluttered up a few inches
from floor and sill and window-seat, and once more,
with tiny starry-dark eyes obseiving me, soundlessly
alighted. ‚ÄúI could hear the infinitesimal tk-tac of their
tiny claws upon the slate. My gaze drifted out of the
window into the garden beyond, a cavern of clearer
crystal and colour than that which astounded the
eyes of young Aladdin.</p>
<p>Apart from the twisted garland of wild flowers,
the shining metal of range and copper candlestick,
and the bright-scoured crockery, there was no adorn-
ment in the room except a rough frame, hanging from
a nail in the wall, and enclosing what appeared to
be a faint patterned fragment of blue silk or fine
linen. The chairs and table were old and heavy. A
low light warbling, an occasional skJrr of wing, a
haze-like drone of bee and fly ‚Äî these were the only
sounds that edg^d a quiet intensified in its profundity
by the remote stirrings of the sea.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe house was stilled as by a charm, yet thought
within me asked no questions; spec^tion was
asleep in its kennel. I sat down to the milk and
bread, the honey and fruit which the old woman laid
out upon the table, and her master seated himself</p>
<p>THE CREATURES 281</p>
<p>opposite to me, now in a low sibilant whisper ‚Äî a
tongue which they seemed to understand ‚Äî address-
ing himself to the birds, and now, as if with an eflFort,
raising those strange grey-green eyes of his to
bestow a quiet remark upon me. He asked, rather
in courtesy than with any active interest, a few
questions, referring to the world, its business and
transports ‚Äî our beautiful world ‚Äî as an astronomer in
the small hours might murmur a few words to the
chance-sent guest of his solitude concerning the
secrets of Uranus or Saturn. There is another, an
inexplorablc side to the moon. Yet he said enough
for me to gather that he, too, was of that small tribe
of the aloof and wild to which our cracked old word
‚Äòforsaken‚Äô might be applied, hermits, lamas, clay-
matted fakirs, and sueb-like ; the snowy birds that
play and cry amid mid-oceanic surges ; the living of
an oasis of the wilderness ; which share a reality only
distantly dreamed of by the time driven thought-
corroded congregations of man.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYet so narrow and hazardous I somehow realised
was the brink of fellow-being (shall I call it?) which
we shared, he and I, that again and again fantasy
within me seemed to hover over that precipice Night
knows as feat. It w&rsquo;as he, it seemed, with that still
embracive contemplation of his, with that far-away
yet reassuring smile, that kept my poise, my balance.
‚ÄòNo,‚Äô some voice within him seemed to utter, ‚Äòyou
are safe ; the bounds are fixed ; though hallucination
chaunt its decoy, you shall not irretrievably pass over.
Eat and drink, and presendy return to ‚Äòlife.‚Äô ‚Äô And I
listened, and, like that of a drowsy child in its cradle.</p>
<p>28 i THE CREATURES</p>
<p>tny consciousness sank deeper and deeper, stilled,
pacified, into the dream amid which, as it seemed,
this soundless house of stone now reared its walls.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI had all but finished my meal when I heard
footsteps approaching on the flags without. The
murmur of other voices, distinguishably shrill yet
guttural even at a distance, and in spite of the dense
stones and beams of the house which had blunted
their timbre, had already reached me. Now. the
feet halted. I turned my head ‚Äî cautiously, even
perhaps apprehensively ‚Äî and confronted two figures
in the doorway.</p>
<p>‚ÄòT cannot now guess the age of my entertainer.
These children‚Äî for children they were in face and
gesture and effect, though as to form and stature
apparently in their last teens ‚Äî these children were
far more problematical. I say ‚Äòform and stature,‚Äô
yet obviously they were dwarfish. Their heads were
sunken betuxen their shoulders, their hair thick,
their eyes disconcertingly deep-set. They were
ungainly, their features peculiarly irregular, as if two
races from the ends of the earth had in them inter-
mingled their blood and strangeness ; as if, rather,
animal and angel had connived in their creation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut if some inward light lay on the still eyes, on
the gaunt, sorrowful, quixotic countenance that
now was fully and intensely bent on mine, emphati-
cally that light was theirs dso. He spoke to them ;
they answered ‚Äî in English, my own language,
without a doubt : but an English slurred, broken,
and unintelligible to me, yet acAX as bell, haunting,
pened^ting, pining as voice of nix or siren. My</p>
<p>THE CREATURES 283</p>
<p>ears drank in the sound as an Arab parched with
desert sand falls on his dried belly and gulps in
mouthfuls of crystal water. The birds hopped nearer
as if beneath ^e rod of an enchanter. A sweet
continuous clamour arose from their small throats.
The exquisite colours of plume and bosom burned,
greened, melted in the level sun-ray, in the darker
air beyond.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA kind of mournful gaiety, a lamentable felicity,
such as rings in the ca^nces of an old folk-song,
welled into my heart. I was come back to the
borders of Eden, bowed and outwearied, gaxing
from out of dream into dream, homesick, ‚Äòforsaken.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúWell, years have gone by,‚Äù muttered my fellow-
traveller deprecatingly, ‚Äúbut I have not forgotten
that Eden‚Äôs primeval trees and shade.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey led me out, these bizarre companions, a
he and a she, if I may put it as crudely as my appre-
hension of them put it to me then. Through a
broad door they conducted me ‚Äî if one who leads
may be said to be conducted ‚Äî into their garden.
Garden ! A full mile long, between undiscemed
walls, it sloped and narrowed towards a sea at whose
dark unfoamed blue, even at this distance, my eyes
dazzled. Yet how can one call that a garden which
reveals no ghost of a sign of human arrangement, of
human slavery, of spade or hoe ?</p>
<p>‚ÄúGreat boulders shouldered up, tessellated, em-
bossed, powdered with a thousand various mosses
and Udhens, between a flowering greenery of weeds.
Wind-stunted, clear-emerald, lichen-tufted trees
smoothed and crisped the inflowing aits of the oc^m</p>
<p>284 THE CREATURES</p>
<p>with their leaves and spines, sibilating a thin scarce-
audible music. Scanty, rank, and uncultivated
fruits hung close their vivid-coloured cheeks to the
gnarled branches. It was the harbourage of birds,
the small embowering parlour of their house of life,
under an evening sky, pure and lustrous as a water-
drop. It cried ‚ÄòHospital‚Äô to the wanderers of the
universe.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs I look back in ever-thinning nebulous
remembrance on my two companions, hear their
voices gutturaUy sweet and shrill, catch again their
being, so to speak, I realise that there was a kind of
Orientalism in their effect. Their instant courtesy
was not Western, the smiles that greeted me, when-
ever I turned my head to look back at them, were
infinitely friendly, yet infinitely remote. So un-
gainly, so far from our notions of beauty and sym-
metry were their bodies and faces, those heads thrust
heavily between their shoulders, their dispropor-
tioned yet graceful arms and hands, that the children
in some of our English villages might be moved to
stone them, while their elders looked on and laughed.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDusk was drawing near ; soon night would
come. The colours of the sunset, sucking its
extremest dye from every leaf and blade and petal,
touched my consciousness even then with a vague
fleeting alarm.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI remember I asked these strange and happy
beings, repeating my question twice or thrice, as wc
neared the surfy entry of the valley upon whose
sands a tiny stream emptied its fresh waters ‚Äî I
asked them if it was they who had planted this</p>
<p>THE CREATURES</p>
<p>285</p>
<p>multitude of flowers, many of a kind utterly un-
known to me and alien to a country inexhaustibly
rich. ‚ÄòWe wait ; we wait 1‚Äô I think they cried. And
it was as if their cry woke echo from the gteen-
waUed valleys of the mind into which I had strayed.
Shall I confess that tears came into my eyes as I gazed
hungrily around me on the harvest of their patience ?</p>
<p>‚ÄúNever was actuality so close to dream. It was
not only an unknown country, slipped in between
these placid hdls, on which I had chanced in my
ramblings. I had entered for a few brief moments
a strange region of consciousness. I was treading,
thus accompanied, amid a world of welcoming and
fearless life ‚Äî oh, friendly to me ! ‚Äî the paths of
man‚Äôs imagination, the kingdom from which thought
and curiosity, vexed scrutiny and lust ‚Äî a lust it
may be for nothing more impious than the actual ‚Äî
had prehistorically proved the insensate means of his
banishment. ‚ÄòReality,‚Äô ‚ÄòConsciousness‚Äô : had he for
‚Äòthe time being‚Äô unwittingly, unhappily missed his
way? Would he be led back at length to that
^den wherein cockatrice and basilisk bask, harm-
lessly, at peace ?</p>
<p>‚ÄúI speculate now. In that queer, yes, and possibly
sinister, company, sinister only because it was alien
to me, I did not speculate. In their garden, the
familiar was become the strange ‚Äî ‚Äòthe strange‚Äô that
lurks in the inmost heart, unburdens its riches in
trance, flings its light and gilding upon love, gives
heavenly savour to the intemperate bowl of passion,
Md is the secret of our incoimnunicable pity. What
is yet queerer, these beings were evidently glad of my</p>
<p>286 THE CREATURES</p>
<p>company. They stumped after me (as might yellow
men after some Occidental quadruped never before
seen) in merry collusion of nods and wreathed
smiles at this perhaps unprecedented intrusion.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI stood for a moment looking out over the placid
surface of the sea. A ^ip in sau hung phantom-like
on the horizon. I pined to call my mscovery to its
seamen. The tide gushed, broke, spent itself on the
bare boulders, I was suddenly cold and alone, and
gladly turned back into the garden, my companions
instinctively separating to let me pass between them.
I breathed in the rare, almost exotic heat, the
tenuous, honeyed, almond-laden air of its flowers and
birds ‚Äî ^guU, sheldrake, plover, wagtail, finch, robin,
which as I half-angrily, half-sadly realised fluttered
up in momentary dismay only at my presence ‚Äî the
embodied spectre of ^eir enemy, man. Man ?
Then who were these ? . . .</p>
<p>‚ÄúI lost again a way lost early that morning, as I
trudged inland at night. The dark came, warm and
starry. I was dejected and exhausted beyond words.
That night I slept in a barn and was awakened
soon after daybreak by the crowing of cocks. I
went out, dazed and blinking into the sunlight,
bathed face and hands in a brook near by, and came
to a village before a soul was stirring. So I sat
under a thrift-cushioned, thorn-crowned wall in a
meadow, and once more drowsed ofi&rdquo; and fell asleep.
When again I awoke, it was ten o‚Äôclock. The
church dock in its tower knelled out the strokes, and
I went into an inn for food.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA corpulent, blonde woman, kindly and hospit-</p>
<p>THE CREATURES 28-7</p>
<p>able, with a face comfortably resembling her own
sow‚Äôs, that yuffed and nosed in at the open door as I
sat on my stool, served me with what I called for.</p>
<p>I described ‚Äî not without some vanishing shame, as
if it were a treachery ‚Äî my farm, its whereabouts.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHer small blue eyes ‚Äòpigged‚Äô at me with a fleeting
expression which I failed to translate. The name of
the farm, it appeared, was Trevarras. ‚ÄòAnd did
you see any of the Creatures ?‚Äô she asked me in a
voice not entirely her own. ‚ÄòThe Creatures ‚Äô ? I
sat back for an instant and stared at her ; then realised
that Creature was the name of my host, and Maria
and Christus (though here her dialect may have
deceived me) the names of my two gardeners. She
spun an absurd story, so far as I could tack it together
and make it coherent. Superstitious stuff about
this man who had wandered m upon the shocked
and curious inhabitants of the district and made his
home at Trevarras ‚Äî a stranger and pilgrim, a
‚Äòforeigner,‚Äô it seemed, of few words, dubious
manners, and both uninformative.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThen there was something (she placed her two
fat hands, one of them wedding-ringed, on the zinc
of the bar-counter, and peered over at me, as if I
were a delectable ‚Äòwash‚Äô), then&rsquo; there was something
about a woman ‚Äòfrom the sea.‚Äô In a ‚Äòblue gown,‚Äô
and either dumb, inarticulate, or mistress of only a
foreign tongue. She must have lived in sin, more-
over, those pig‚Äôs eyes seemed to yearn, since the
children were ‚Äòsimple,‚Äô ‚Äònaturals‚Äô ‚Äî as God intends in
such matters. It was useless. One‚Äôs stomach may
sometimes reject the cold sanative aerated water of</p>
<p>288 THE CREATURES</p>
<p>‚Äòthe next morning,‚Äô and my ridiculous intoxication
had left me dry but not yet quite sober.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnyhow, this she told me, that my blue woman,
as fair as flax, had died and was buried in the neigh-
bouring churchyard (the nearest to, though miles
distant from, Trevarras). She repeatedly assured
me, as if I might otherwise doubt so sophisticated
a fact, that I should find her grave there, her ‚Äòstone.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo indeed I did ‚Äî ^far away from the elect, and
in a shade-ridden north-west corner of the sleepy,
cropless acre : a slab, scarcely rounded, of granite,
with but a name bitten out of the dark rough surface,
*Femina Creature</p>
<p>THE RIDDLE</p>
<p>S o these seven children, Ann, and Matilda, James,
William and Henry, Harriet and Dorothea,
came to live with their grandmother. The
house m which their grandmother had lived since her
childhood was built in the time of the Georges. It
was not a pretty house, but roomy, substantial, and
square ; and an elm-tree outstretched its branches
almost to the windows.</p>
<p>When the children were come out of the cab (five
sitting inside and tv&rsquo;O beside the driver), they were
shown into their grandmother‚Äôs presence. They
stood in a httle black group before the old lady,
seated in her bow-window. And she asked them
each their names, and repeated each name in her kind,
quavering voice. Then to one she gave a work-box,
to Wilham a jack-knife, to Dorothea a painted ball ;
to each a present according to age. And she kissed
all her grand-children to the youngest.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy dears,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúI wish to see all of you
bright and gay in my house. I am an old woman, so
that I cannot romp with you ; but Ann must look
to you, and Mrs. Fenn too. And every morning and
every evening you must all come in to see your
granny ; and bring me smihng faces, that call back to
my mind my own son Harry. But all the rest of the
day, when school is done, you shall do just as you
please, my dears. And there is only one thing,
just one, I would have you remember. In the large
spare bedroom that looks out on the slate roof there
stands in the corner an old oak chest ; aye, older
than I, my dears, a great deal older ; older than my</p>
<p>290 THE RIDDLE</p>
<p>grandmother. Play anywhere else in the house, but
not there.‚Äù She spoke kindly to them all, smiling
at them ; but she was very aged, and her eyes seemed
to see nothing of this world.</p>
<p>And the seven children, though at first they were
gloomy and strange, soon began to be happy and at
home in the great house. There was much to interest
and to amuse them there ; all was new to them.
Twice every day, morning and evening, they came
in to see their grandmother, who every day seemed
more feeble ; and she spoke pleasantly to them of
her mother, and her childhood, but never forgetting
to visit her store of sugar-plums. And so the weeks
passed by.</p>
<p>It was evening twilight when Henry went upstairs
from the nursery by himself to look at the oak chest.
He pressed his fingers into the carved fruit and
flowers, and spoke to the dark-smiling heads at the
corners ; and then, with a glance over his shoulder,
he opened the lid and looked in. But the chest con-
cealed no treasure, neither gold nor baubles, nor was
there anything to alarm the eye. The chest was
empty, except that it was lined with silk of old-rose,
seeming darker in the dusk, and smelling sweet of
pot-pourri. And while Henry was looking in, he
heard the softened laughter and the clinking of the
cups downstairs in the nursery ; and out at the win-
dow he saw the day darkening These things brought
strangely to his memory his mother who in her
glimmering white dress used to read to him in the
dusk ; and he climbed into the chest ; and the lid
closed gently down over him.</p>
<p>THE RIDDLE 1^1</p>
<p>When the other six children were tired with their
playing, they filed into their grandmother‚Äôs room
as usual for her good-night and her sugar-plums. She
looked out between the candles at them as if she
were unsure of something in her thoughts. The next
day Ann told her grandmother that Henry was not
anywhere to be found.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDearie me, child. Then he must be gone away
for a time,‚Äù said the old lady. She paused. ‚ÄúBut re-
member all of you, do not meddle with the oak chest.‚Äù</p>
<p>But Matilda could not forget her brother Henry,
finding no pleasure in playing without him So she
would loiter in the house thinking where he might
be. And she carried her wood doll in her bare arms,
singing under her breath all she could make up
about him. And when in a bright morning she
peeped in on the chest, so sweet-scented and secret
it seemed that she took her doll with her into it ‚Äî
just as Henry himself had done.</p>
<p>So Ann, and James, and Wilham, Harriet and
Dorothea were left at home to play together. ‚ÄúSome
day maybe they will come back to you, my dears,‚Äù said
their grandmother, ‚Äúor maybe you will go to them.
Heed my warning as best you may.‚Äù</p>
<p>Now Harriet and William were friends together,
pretending to be sweethearts ; while James and
Dorothea liked wild games of hunting, and fishing,
and battles.</p>
<p>On a silent afternoon in October Harriet and
William were talking softly together, looking out
over the slate roof at the green fields, and they heard
the squeak and frisking of a mouse behind them in the</p>
<p>THE RIDDLE</p>
<p>292</p>
<p>room. They went together and searched for the
small, dark hole from whence it had come out. But
finding no hole, they began to finger the carving
of the chest, and to give names to the dark-smiling
heads, just as Henry had done. ‚ÄúI know ! let‚Äôs pre-
tend you are Sleeping Beauty, Harriet,‚Äù said William,
‚Äúand I‚Äôll be the Prince that squee2es through the
thorns and comes in.‚Äù Harriet looked gently and
strangely at her brother ; but she got into the box
and lay down, pretending to be fast asleep ; and on
tiptoe William leaned over, and seeing how big
was the chest he stepped in to kiss the Sleeping
Beauty and to wake her from her quiet sleep. Slowly
the carved lid turned on its noiseless hinges. And
only the clatter of James and Dorothea came in
sometimes to recall Ann from her book.</p>
<p>But their old grandmother was very feeble, and her
sight dim, and her hearing extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Snow was falling through the still air upon the
roof ; and Dorothea was a fish in the oak chest,
and James stood over the hole in the ice, brandishing
a walking-stick for a harpoon, pretending to be an
Esquimaux. Dorothea‚Äôs face was red, and her wild
eyes sparkled through her tousled hair. And James
had a crooked scratch upon his cheek. ‚ÄúYou must
struggle, Dorothea, and then I shall swim back and
drag you out. Be quick now 1‚Äù He shouted with
laughter as he was drawn into the open chest. And
the lid closed softly and gently down as before.</p>
<p>Ann, left to herself, was too old to care overmuch
for sugar-plums, but she would go solitary to bid her
grandmother good-night; and the old kdy looked</p>
<p>THE RIDDLE</p>
<p>293</p>
<p>wistfully at her over her spectacles. ‚ÄúWell, my dear,‚Äù
she said with trembling head; and she squeezed
Ann‚Äôs fingers between her own knuckled finger and
thumb, ‚ÄúWhat lonely old people, we are, to be
sure !‚Äù Ann kissed her grandmother‚Äôs soft, loose
cheek. She left the old lady sitting in her easy chair,
her hands upon her knees, and her head turned
sidelong towards her.</p>
<p>When Ann was gone to bed she used to sit reading
her book by candlelight. She drew up her knees
under the sheets, resting her book upon them. Her
story was about fairies and gnomes, and the gently-
flowing moonlight of the narrative seemed to illumine
the white pages, and she could hear in fancy fairy
voices, so silent was the great many-roomed house,
and so mellifluent were the words of the story.
Presently she put out her candle, and, with a con-
fused babel of voices close to her ear, and faint swift
pictures before her eyes, she fell asleep.</p>
<p>And in the dead of night she arose out of bed in
dream, and with eyes wide open yet seeing nothing of
reality, moved silently through the vacant house.
Past the room where her grandmother was snoring
in brief, heavy slumber, she stepped light and surely,
and down the wide staircase. And Vega the far-
shining stood over against the window above the
slate roof. Ann walked in the strange room as if she
were being guided by the hand towards the oak
chest. There, just as if she was dreaming it was her
bed, she laid herself down in the old rose silk, in the
fragrant place. But it was so dark in the room that
the movement of the lid was indistinguishable.</p>
<p>THE RIDDLE</p>
<p>294</p>
<p>Through the long day, the grandmother sat in her
bow-window. Her lips were pursed, and she looked
with dim, inquisitive scrutiny upon the street where
people passed to and fro, and vehicles rolled by.
At evening she climbed the stair and stood in the
doorway of the large spare bedroom. The ascent
had shortened her breath. Her magnifying spectacles
rested upon her nose. Leaning her hand on the
doorpost she peered in towards the glimmering
square of window in the quiet gloom. But she
could not see far, because her sight was dim and the
light of day feeble. Nor could she detect the faint
fragrance, as of autumnal leaves. But in her mind
was a tangled skein of memories ‚Äî laughter and tears,
and little children now old-fashioned, and the advent
of friends, and long farewells. And gossiping fitfuUy,
inarticulately, with herself, the old lady went down
again to her window-seat.</p>
<p>THE VATS</p>
<p>M any years ago now ‚Äî ^in that once upon a
time which is the memory of the imagin-
ation rather than of the workaday mind,</p>
<p>I went walking with a friend. Of what passed before
we set out I have nothing but the vaguest recollec-
tion, All I remember is that it was early morning,
that we were happy to be in one another‚Äôs company,
that there were bright green boughs overhead
amongst which the birds floated and sang, and that
the early dews still burned in their crystal in the sun.</p>
<p>We were taking our way almost at haphazard ac-
ross country, there was now grass, now the faintly
sparkling flinty dust of an English road, underfoot.
With remarkably few humans to be seen, we trudged
on, turning our eyes ever and again to glance laugh-
ingly, questioningly, or perplexedly at one another‚Äôs,
then slanting them once more on the blue-canopied
countryside. It was Spring, in the month of May, I
think, and we were talking of Time.</p>
<p>We speculated on what it was, and where it went
to, touched in furtive tones on the Fourth Dimension
and exchanged ‚Äòthe Magic Formula.‚Äô We wondered
if pigs could see time as they see the wind, and wished
we could recline awhile upon those bewitching banks
where it grows wild. We confessed to each other how
of late we had been pining in our secret hearts for just
a brief spell of an eternity of it. Time wherein we could
be and think and dream aU that each busy, hugger-
&lsquo;‚Äú^^gger, feverish, precipitate twenty-four hours
would not allow us to be or to think or dream. Im-</p>
<p>296 THE VATS</p>
<p>practicable, infatuate desire ! We desired to muse, to
brood, to meditate, to embark (with a buoyant cargo)
upon that quiet stream men call reverie. We had all
but forgotten how even to sleep. We lay like Argus
of nights with all out hundred eyes ajar.</p>
<p>There were books we should never now be able to
read ; speculations we should never be able to ex-
plore ; riddles we should never so much as hear put,
much less expounded. There were, above all, waking
visions now past hoping for ; long since shut away
from us by the stream of the hasty moments ‚Äî as they
tick and silt and slide irrecoverably away. In the gay
folly of that bright morning we could almost have
vowed there were even other ‚Äúselves‚Äù awaiting us
with whom no kind of precarious tryst we had ever
made we had ever been faithful to. Perhaps they and
we would be ready if only the world‚Äôs mechanical
clocks would cease their trivial morahsings.</p>
<p>And memories ‚Äî surely they would come arrowing
home in the first of the evening to haunts serene
and unmolested, if only the weather and mood and
season and housing we could offer were decently pro-
pitious. We had frittered away, squandered so many
days, weeks, years ‚Äî and had saved so litde. Spend-
thrifts of the unborrowable, we had been living on
our capital ‚Äî a capital bringing in how meagre an
‚Äúinterest‚Äù ‚Äî and were continually growing poorer.
Once, when we were children, and in our own world,
an hour had been as capacious as the blue bowl of the
sky, and of as refreshing a milk. Now its successors
JuggM^y snatched their way past our sluggardsemes
like thieves piirsued.</p>
<p>THE VATS 297</p>
<p>Like an hour glass that cannot tell the difference
between its head and its heels ; like a dial on a sunless
day ; like a timepiece wound-up ‚Äî wound-up and
bereft of its pendulum ; so were we. Age, we had
hideously learned, devours life as a river consumes
flakes of the falling snow. Soon we should be beggars,
with scarcely a month to our name ; and none to give
us alms.</p>
<p>I confess that at this crisis in out talk I caught an
uncomfortable glimpse of the visionary stallions of
my hearse ‚Äî ink-black streaming manes and tails ‚Äî
positively galloping me off ‚Äî wreaths, glass, corpse
and all, to keep their dismal appointment with the
grave : and even at that, abominably late.</p>
<p>Indeed, out minds had at length become so pro-
foundly engaged in these pictures and forebodings as
we paced on, that a complete aeon might have mean-
whfle swept over out heads. We had t^ked ourselves
into a kind of oblivion. Nor had either of us given
the least thought to our direction or destination. We
had been following not even so much as our noses.
And then suddenly, we ‚Äúcame to.‚Äù Maybe it was the
unwonted silence ‚Äî a silence unbroken even by the
harplike drone of noonday ‚Äî ^that recalled us to our-
selves. Maybe the ait in these unfamiliar parts was
of a crisper quality, or the mere effect of the strange-
ness around us had muttered in secret to our inward
spirits. Whether or not, we both of us discovered at
the same instant and as if at a signal, that without
being aware of it, and while still our tongues were
wagging on together on our old-fashioned theme, we
had come into sight of the Vats. We looked up, and</p>
<p>THE VATS</p>
<p>298</p>
<p>lo ! ‚Äî they lay there in the middle distance, in cluster
enormous under the cloudless sky : and here were we !</p>
<p>Imagine two age-scarred wolf-skinned humans of
prehistoric days paddling along at shut of evening on
some barbarous errand, and suddenly from a sweep-
ing crest on Salisbury Plain descrying on the nearer
horizon the awful monoliths of Stonehenge. An
experience resembling that was ours this summer day.</p>
<p>We came at once to a standstill amid the far-flung
stretches of the unknown plateau on which we had
re-found ourselves, and with eyes fixed upon these
astonishing objects, stood and stared. I have called
them Vats. Vats they were not ; but rather sunken
Reservoirs ; vast semi-spherical primeval Cisterns, of
an area many times that of the bloated and swollen</p>
<p>g someters which float like huge flattened bubbles
tween earth and heaven under the sunlit clouds of
the Thames. But no sunbeams dispread themselves
here. They lay slumbering in a grave, crystal Mght,
which lapped, deep as the Tuscarora Trough, above
and around their prodigious stone plates, or slats,
or slabs, or laminae ; their steep slopes washed by
the rarefied atmosphere of their site, and in hue of a
hoary green.</p>
<p>As we gazed at them like this from afar they
seemed to be in number, as I remember, about nine,
but they were by no means all of a size. For one or
two of the rotundas were smaller in compass than
the others, just as there may be big snails or mush-
rooms in a family, and little ones.</p>
<p>But any object on earth of a majesty or magnitude
that recalls the pyramids is a formidable spectacle.</p>
<p>THE VATS 299</p>
<p>And not a word passed between us, scarcely a glance,
as with extreme caution and circumspection we ap-
proached ‚Äî creeping human pace by pace ‚Äî to view
them nearer.</p>
<p>A fit of shivering came over me, I recollect, as thus
advantaged I scanned their enormous sides, shaggy
with tufts of a monstrous moss and scarred with
yard-wide circumambulations of lichen. Gigantic
grasses stooped their fatted seedpods from the least
rough ledge. They might be walls of ice, so cold
their aspect ; or of a matter discoverable only in an
alien planet.</p>
<p>Not ‚Äî though they were horrific to the eye ‚Äî not
that they were in themselves appalling to the soul.
Fat rather they seemed to be emblems of an ineffable
peace ; harmless as, centuries before Noah, were the
playing leviathans in a then privy Pacific. And when
one looked close on them it was to see myriads of
animated infinitesimals in crevice and cranny, of a
beauty, hue and symmetry past eye to seize. Indeed,
there was a hint remotely human in the looks of
these Vats. The likeness between them resembled
that between generations of mankind, countless
generations old. Contemplating them with the un-
paralleled equanimity their presence at last bestowed,
one might almost have ventured to guess their
names. And never have I seen sward or turf so
smooth and virginally emerald as that which heaved
itself against their brobdingnagian flanks.</p>
<p>Mv friend and I, naturaJly enough, were acutely
conscious of our minuteness of stature as we stood
side by side in this unrecorded solitude, and, out of</p>
<p>THE VATS</p>
<p>300</p>
<p>our little round heads, peered up at them with out
eves. Obviously their muscous incrustations and
the families of weeds flourishing in their interstices
were of an age to daunt the imagination. Their
ancestry must have rooted itself here when the
dinosaur and the tribes of the megatherium roamed
earth‚Äôs crust and the pterodactyl ckshed through its
twilight ‚Äî ^thousands of centuries before the green
acorn sprouted that was to afford little Cain in a fallen
world nis first leafy pettiroat&rsquo;;. I realised as if at a
sigh why smiles the Sphinx ; why the primary stars
have blazed on in undiminishing midnight lustre
during Man‚Äôs brief history, and his childish constella-
tions have scarcely by a single inch of heaven changed
in their apparent stations.</p>
<p>They wore that air of lovely timelessness which
decks the thorn, and haimts for the half-woken sense
the odour of sweet-brier ; yet they were grey with
the everlasting, as ate the beards of the patriarchs
and the cindery craters of the Moon. Theirs was the
semblance of having been lost, forgotten, abandoned,
like some foundered Nereid-haunted derelict of the
first sailors, rotting in dream upon an undiscovered
shore. They htmehed their vast shapes out of the
green beneath the sunless blue of space, and for
untrodden leagues around them stretched like a
paradisal savanna what we poor thronging clock-
vexed men call Silence. Solitude.</p>
<p>In teUing of these Vats it is difficult to convey in
mere wortk even a fraction of their-effcct upon out
minds. And not merely our minds. They called to
some hidden being within us that, if not their coeval.</p>
<p>T H E V A T S 301</p>
<p>was. at least aware of their exqiiisite antiquity.
Whether of archangelic or daemonic construction,
clearly they had remained unvisitcd by mortal man
for as many centuries at least as there are cherries in
Damascus or beads in Tierra del Fuego. Sharers of
this thought, we two dwarf visitors had whispered
an instant or so together, face to face ; and then were
again mute.</p>
<p>Yes, we were of one mind about that. In the ut-
most depths of our imaginations it was clear to us
that these supremely solitary objects, if not positively
cast out of thought, had hecn abandoned.</p>
<p>But by whom ? My friend and I had sometimes
talked of the divine Abandoner ; and also (if one can,
and may, distinguish between mood and person, be-
tween the dream and the dreamer) of Tt. Here was
the vacancy of His presence ; just as one may be
aware of a filament of His miracle in the smiling
beauty that hovers above the swaying grasses of an
indecipherable grave-stone.</p>
<p>Looking back on the heatless and rayless noonday
of those Vats, I see, as I have said, the mere bodies
of my friend and me, the upright bones of us, indes-
cribably dwarfed by their antediluvian monstrosity.
Yet within the lightless bellies of these sarcophagi
were heaped up, we were utterly assured (though bow^
I know not) floods, beyond measure, of the waters
for which our souls had pined. Waters, imaginably
so cleat as to be dense, as if of melted mem more
translucent even than crystal ; of such a tenuous
purity that not even the moonlit branches of a dream
would spell their reflex in them ; so costly, so far</p>
<p>THE VATS</p>
<p>302</p>
<p>beyond price, that this whole stony world‚Äôs rubies
and sapphires and amethysts of Mandalay and Guad-
alajara and Solikamsk, all the treasure-houses of Cam-
balech and the booty of King Tamburlane would
suffice to purchase not one drop.</p>
<p>It is indeed the unseen, the imagined, the untold-of,
the fabulous, the forgotten that alone lies safe from
mortal moth and rust ; and these Vats ‚Äî their very
silence held us spellbound, as were the Isles before
the Sirens sang.</p>
<p>But how, it may be asked ; No sound ? No spectral
tread ? No faintest summons ? And not the minutest
iota of a superscription ? None. I sunk my very
being into nothingness, so that I seemed to become
but a shell receptive of the least of whispers. But the
multitudinous life that was here was utterly silent.
No sigh, no ripple, no pining chime of rilling drop
within. Waters of life ; but infinitely still.</p>
<p>I may seem to have used extravagant terms. My
friend and I used none. We merely stood in dumo
survey of these crusted, butt-like domes of stone,
wherein slept Elixir Vita, whose last echo had been
the Choragium of the morning stars.</p>
<p>God knows there are potent explosives in these
latter days. My friend and I had merely the nails
upon our fingers, a pen-knife and a broken pair of
scissors in our pockets. We might have scraped seven
and seventy score growths of a Nebuchadnezzar‚Äôs
talons down to the quick, and yet have left all but
unmarked and unscarred those mossed and mon-
strous laminae. But we had tasted the untastable, and
were refreshed in spirit at least a little more endurably</p>
<p>THE VATS 303</p>
<p>than ate the camel-riders of the Sahara dream-ridden
by mirage.</p>
<p>We knew now and for ever that Time-pure is ;
that here‚Äî somewhere awaiting us and all forlorn
mankind ‚Äî lay hid the solace of our mortal longing ;
that doubtless the Seraph whose charge is the living
waters will in the divine hour fetch down his iron
key in his arms, and ‚Äî well. Dives, rich man and
crumb-waster that he was, pleaded out of the flames
for but one drop of them. Neither my friend nor I
was a Dives then, nor was ever likely to be. And
now only I remain.</p>
<p>We were Children of Lazarus, ageiug, footsore,
dusty and athirst. We smiled ope^y and with an
extraordinary gentle felicity at one another ‚Äî his eyes
and mine ‚Äî as we turned away from the Vats.</p>
