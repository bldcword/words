Reflections‚ÄîLetter from Lady Hester to the Author asking him to return‚ÄîHe revisits Syria‚ÄîChanges which had taken place in Beyrout‚ÄîM. Jasper Chasseaud, American consul‚ÄîDivine service performed by the American missionaries‚ÄîLetter from Lady Hester to the Author‚ÄîHer continued hostility to Mrs. ‚Äî.‚ÄîThe Author takes his family to Sayda‚ÄîDress and demeanour of a lady of Sayda‚ÄîThe Author‚Äôs reception at J√¥on‚ÄîHis family frightened by a deserter‚ÄîSettles at the convent of Mar Elias‚ÄîEarthquake of January 1, 1837.</p>
<p>We now arrive at an epoch in Lady Hester Stanhope‚Äôs life, when it might be said that her European reputation had reached its height, and her domestic humiliations had sunk her to the lowest ebb. She had been visited in her retirement by so many travellers of all the nations of the Continent, that it might be supposed her singular mode of life was known to almost everybody. M. Lamartine‚Äôs account of his interview had spread abroad an undefined sort of wonder about her mystic and singular opinions, and209 the public read with avidity whatever details they could meet with respecting her.</p>
<p>Six years had now elapsed since our separation; and, although occasionally honoured with a letter from her, I had given up all idea of ever seeing her again, when, being at Nice, where I had furnished a house, with the intention of passing two or three years with my family, I received the following letter.</p>
<p>Lady H. S. to Dr. ‚Äî‚Äî.</p>
<p>August 21st, 1836.</p>
<p>I hope I shall not claim in vain the assistance of an old friend, at the moment I most require one I can depend upon, to settle the business of my debts, &amp;c., now made public. Money has been left me, which has been concealed from me. I could hardly, at first, believe it, until I was assured of it by a young lawyer, who had the fact from one of my Irish relations. I should wish you to come as soon as you can possibly make it convenient to yourself, and return when the business is over.</p>
<p>[I omit a passage, of no general interest, in which Lady Hester arranges the mode of transit by which I was to visit her, assures me that she will ‚Äúthink of my family before anything else,‚Äù and refers to the losses she had sustained by the non-payment of certain bills.]</p>
<p>210An English traveller, who has written, as I am informed, a very learned work, told a person that, when M. Lamartine‚Äôs book first came out in England, the impression was so strong that many people, who did not personally know me, talked of coming here to investigate my affairs, and to offer their services, but that they were prevented. A woman, of high rank and good fortune,[54] who has built herself a palais in a remote part of America, has announced her intention of passing the rest of her life with me, so much has she been struck with my situation and conduct. She is nearly of my age; and, thirty-seven or thirty-eight years ago‚ÄîI being personally unknown to her‚Äîwas so taken with my general appearance, that she never could divest herself of the thoughts of me, which have ever since pursued her. At last, informed by M. Lamartine‚Äôs book where I was to be found, she took this extraordinary determination, and in the spring I expect her. She is now selling her large landed estate, preparatory to her coming. She, as well as L√´ila, the mare, is in the prophecy. (See page 179.) The beautiful boy has also written, and is wandering over the face of the globe, till destiny marks the period of our meeting.</p>
<p>Such wonders, doctor! Copy these signs upon another paper, and remain silent upon the subject. 211Bring with you your notes upon Palmyra, &amp;c.‚Äîdo not forget. Perhaps I may receive from you an answer to my former letter by the next steamboat; but, as it only remains an hour at Beyrout, this must be sent off to be in waiting there. God bless you!</p>
<p>[Not signed.]</p>
<p>(Lady Hester seems to have been interrupted in her writing, and breaks off; but she thus resumes:)</p>
<p>The little black is not twelve years old, yet she does my bed-room, and answers the bell: she is the only good-tempered black I have seen; so I try to please her, poor thing! If you come, I should, therefore, wish (if not too expensive) that you should bring, as an encouragement, a pair of ear-rings, a string of beads, a pair of bracelets, and a thimble. Her ears, having been spoilt with boring and heavy ear-rings, were obliged to be bored again, very high, nearer the face‚Äîit is a beautiful ear.</p>
<p>Now, what I want for myself is six cups and saucers; the top, I think, four inches in diameter; height, four inches; foot, two inches. I had a cup I was so fond of; for tea and coffee tasted so good out of it! It was strong and good china, but it is gone: and one cup held enough for my breakfast‚Äîa moderate cup and a half. I want also a teapot, black or red, or what you like; two cream-jugs; four milk-jugs, in case two are broken,‚Äîbeing always in use‚Äîone212 for hot and one for cold milk; six plates; four glass things, for butter and honey; a toast-rack, not plated‚Äîa plated one for strangers; a dozen basins; some little phials and corks; a few common candlesticks, brass, or something strong; a few common entangling combs; a few scrubbing-brushes for the kitchen‚Äîthat is all.</p>
<p>I do not want any books, having no one to read to me: it even puts my eyes out to write this.</p>
<p>I have heard of your situation, and it pains me beyond expression. Here you might, I believe, have been happy, and I also comfortable, as I have confidence in your integrity; and, whilst you were regulating all as I should have wished, you would have pursued those avocations most pleasing to your taste. What advice can I give you that I have not already given fifty times?</p>
<p>Of myself, I can say but little which is amusing; for, from the time the Egyptian troops entered this country until now, I have been in hot water. After the siege,[55] all that remained of the wretched population fled here, and my house and the village were, for the space of three years, the tower of Babel. Indeed, it was only at the beginning of this year that I got rid of the last of eighteen persons of one family, all orphans and widows; and only a lad, who was not 213capable, from his want of education, of gaining anything for himself and family, remained. I had, at one time, seventy-five coverlets out for strangers, chiefly soldiers‚Äîthe village full of families‚Äîand those at Sayda and other places coming and going for a little money to buy their daily bread.</p>
<p>I have saved many lives by my energy and determination, and have stood alone in such a storm! All trembled, Franks as much as the rest; and, if they pretended to act with a little spirit, they were sure to have folly, and not justice, on their side, and to be at last obliged to give in: but the most of them joined, heart and hand, with the usurpers, whom I have treated without mercy, and, in the end, carried all before me. God helped me in all; for, otherwise, I never could have got through with it, having no one of any sort of use to me.</p>
<p>Lunardi, Mr. Webb‚Äôs man, whom you so strongly recommended to me, turned himself into a doctor, and was too much taken up with his new title to be of any use to me: yet this useless Lunardi is a good-hearted fellow. Were you to see him now, however, you would hardly know him; his manners are so improved, as well as his understanding: I believe, also, that he is attached to me.</p>
<p>Anxiety, agitation, and fatigue, together with the violent passions I sometimes put myself in, caused me,214 only a year ago, to vomit blood enough several times to have killed a horse. In seven days it stopped; but yet I was obliged to be bled eleven times in four months and a half, fearing a return. Yesterday, I was working like a fellah [ploughman] in my garden. I am very thin, but contented about my health, as this gives proof of my natural strength. With the blood running out of my mouth, I was collected enough to give orders respecting a man, who, if he had been caught, would have lost his head; and no soul in the family knew of this but one, who insisted on seeing me in the state I was in: and although I could hardly speak, I reflected much, and, thank God! settled all to my satisfaction.</p>
<p>Abdallah Pasha has behaved very ill at Constantinople‚Äîa vain, stupid fool, without heart and without common sense: but it is for the Sultan that I have worked, as I am really attached to him, he being a most superior character.</p>
<p>Your friend Urquhart will be very useful to Lord Ponsonby, who, though a sensible man, is idle. Should U. gain the confidence of the Turks, he may learn their opinion of me; but he must not repeat it to the Franks, as a great jealousy exists respecting my politics. I have long foretold the change that must take place in those of the French and English, and now say that Sultan Mahmood will be mans√¥or [victorious.]</p>
<p>215P.[56] has gambled away nearly five hundred dollars I gave him about four years ago for things that I wanted, and never sent me anything.</p>
<p>Do not be uneasy about my health; for an English medical man, who came here after my illness, said he never saw such a constitution in his life, and that my pulse was then a better pulse than his.</p>
<p>I am reckoned here the first politician in the world, and by some a sort of prophet. Even the Emir [Besh√Ωr] wonders, and is astonished; for he was not aware of this extraordinary gift formerly: but yet, all say‚ÄîI mean enemies‚Äîthat I am worse than a lion when in a passion, and that they cannot deny I have justice on my side.</p>
<p>Write whenever you please; do not expect me to write, as it hurts my eyes too much, and I have no one to assist me.</p>
<p>[Signed] ‚ÄÉ H. L. S.</p>
<p>This summons from Lady Hester Stanhope took me a little unexpectedly. I had not much faith in a story like that on which she built her hopes of paying her debts; for I did not think it likely that property left to her could have been purposely concealed from her knowledge, or would be withheld from her by her relations: but, notwithstanding this, I 216did not hesitate to write immediately, and say I would come as soon as I could arrange my private concerns, which period I limited to the following spring.</p>
<p>Accordingly, having engaged a governess for my daughter, to be at the same time a companion for my wife in the long evenings during my sittings with Lady Hester Stanhope, we left Nice on the 24th of May, 1837, for Marseilles; and agreed there for our passage on board of the Zoave, Captain Robert, a tight brigantine, paying, for the exclusive use of the cabin and our provisions, 1000 francs. We embarked on the 6th of June, being my fifty-fourth birthday, and, after a prosperous voyage, landed at Beyrout on the 1st of July, 1837.</p>
<p>The city of Beyrout had undergone great changes since the conquest of Syria by Ibrahim Pasha; not in the tortuosity of its streets, not in its broken pavement and the filthy entrances to its houses, but in the appearance of its population. Formerly, a few straggling Europeans, or Levantines in European dresses, were seen hanging about the doors of a warehouse or two in the Frank quarter; and occasionally a European woman, the wife of a consul or a merchant, would steal from one house to another, as if afraid, in her way, of insult from a fanatic Turk. Now, the bustle of a crowded mart was visible, and217 Europeans and their ladies walked about with a freedom which showed that a strong arm kept the haughty Mussulman under control. In 1831, the appearance of a French lady in the streets, wearing a green silk gown, was signalized as a feat of great hardihood; such an assumption of the colour peculiar to the prophet Mahomet‚Äôs descendants generally entailing vexations on the wearer: and a gentleman would never have dared to give his arm to a lady out of doors: but now, both the one and the other passed on without any loud remark, although, internally, the grave Mussulmans cherished a feeling of vengeance against those who so openly violated their religious and moral institutions. Emboldened by these changes, I led my family through the bazars, and showed them the busy Christians and Turks, working with their fingers and toes those beautiful silk stuffs, purses, cords, ribbons, &amp;c., which form the admiration of all persons who visit the Levant.</p>
<p>We were lodged at the inn kept by Pareschiv√†, formerly a servant of Mr. John Maddox, an English gentleman, who had made a stay of two or three years in Syria. This Greek, by his cleanliness and attention, had secured, in an album which he kept for the purpose, so many certificates of good entertainment from travellers who had put up at his inn, that it would have required some courage to raise a dissenting218 voice: but he maintained, by a continuance of the same attentions to his guests, the reputation he had justly acquired.</p>
<p>The environs of Beyrout had always been studded with small villas and garden-cottages, but some very handsome country-houses had now risen up among them. New houses had also been built in the town; and among them were two, the property of our old acquaintance, M. Jasper Chasseaud, now become American consul, one of which he inhabited. We had the pleasure of complimenting him on his new dignity, and partaking of his hospitality in a splendid saloon, overlooking the shipping and port, and commanding an extensive view of Mount Lebanon. M. Guys, the French consul, and his estimable lady, also entertained us; and, could our stay have been prolonged here, we should have had no great reason to regret the delightful society of Nice.</p>
<p>I hastened to inform Lady Hester Stanhope of our arrival, and, whilst waiting for the camels and mules which she would probably send, I made the necessary preparations for the road. A cook was hired, named Cab√¥or, who, some twenty or five-and-twenty years before, had been my servant boy. Great was his joy at seeing his old master. He was destined, however, to remain but a short time with us, as I discovered that he had been turned away from Lady Hester219 Stanhope‚Äôs service, a circumstance which, of course, rendered it impossible for me to retain him in mine.</p>
<p>We attended divine service, performed by the American missionaries in the great saloon of M. Chasseaud‚Äôs house, and were much edified by the exemplary piety of these good men, who were labouring to spread general information among the Syrians, by giving gratuitous instruction to the children of the inhabitants, by printing useful books of practical knowledge in Arabic, and by leading them, through reading and meditation, to work their own way to salvation; trusting that an acquaintance with the scriptures and with the advantages of civilization will silently effect the pious object they have in view, without those violent attempts at conversion which cause enmity between brethren, and defeat their own end.</p>
<p>M. Guys lent us a handsome green double marquee, and all preparations were made for our departure, when two servants arrived from her ladyship, with her own mules, and the following answer to my letter.</p>
<p>Lady Hester Stanhope to Dr. ‚Äî‚Äî, at Beyrout.</p>
<p>Djo√ªn, July 1, 1837.‚ÄÉ
Saturday night.</p>
<p>Dear Doctor,</p>
<p>I have sent you Botr√¥os Metta, with the mules necessary for your trunks and what you want220 immediately. Your heavy luggage had better go by sea.</p>
<p>I could wish you, first of all, to come here alone, to see a house at Sayda for your family, and to well understand each other before you bring them here. For your sake, I should ever wish to show civility to all who belong to you, but caprice I will never interfere with: for, from my early youth, I have been taught to despise it. Botr√¥os Metta, if he can be useful to Mrs. ‚Äî‚Äî, may remain until your return; if not, he will come with you. I hope your health is quite recovered, and, in the end, that you will have no reason to regret your voyage.</p>
<p>Yours, sincerely,</p>
<p>Hester Lucy Stanhope.</p>
<p>So then, thought I, the past is never to be forgotten; and, hardly have we set foot on the shores of Syria, but war is declared against my wife. Lady Hester Stanhope made no mystery of her likes and dislikes; and Botr√¥os Metta, in his confabulations with Cab√¥or (as servants in general talk about their masters and mistresses) dwelt on the rising storm, which probably would soon burst. Cab√¥or bore no good will to her ladyship. He had picked up a little French, and his reflections on my situation were not deficient in shrewdness. ‚ÄúAh!‚Äù he would exclaim,221 ‚Äúit will be just as it was six years ago‚Äîmy mistress crying, my lady emport√©e, and my master trying to satisfy both‚Äîno easy task! He will have one woman saying one thing in one ear, and the other saying the contrary in the other ear; well! he will be a clever gentleman if he reconciles them!‚Äù</p>
<p>As it would not have been proper to leave my family in an inn, I resolved to take them with me at once to Sayda, notwithstanding Lady Hester‚Äôs suggestion to the contrary. On the 3rd of July, at sunset, we commenced our journey; for the weather was too hot to travel in the daytime. It was pitch dark; nothing whatever was visible; we could not even see the path before us: but Abdhu, the mule-driver, and Botr√¥os, led the way, and each person had a driver by his side. We were, therefore, spared the horrors of the surrounding scenery, which M. de Lamartine describes in such imaginative diction. In four hours we reached Khaldy, where the tent was pitched on the seashore; and, after supping on a p√¢t√© √† la Perigord, with which Madame Guys had kindly provided us, and taking a cup of nice Mocha coffee, we lay down in our clothes, and slept until the morning star made its appearance: then, remounting, we marched four hours more, which brought us to Nebby Yuness, where we breakfasted on coffee and milk and the remains of our provision basket. Here222 we rested until three in the afternoon, and then proceeded along the seashore to Sayda. When within about a quarter of a mile of the town-gates, we met M. Conti, the French consular agent, and from him learned that the earthquake had so damaged the city, and the French khan in particular, that he could not give us lodging in it, but politely offered us his garden, where, under the shade of the trees, we might pitch our tent. The gardens, or rather orchards of Sayda, occupy a flat strip of land which intervenes between the seashore and the foot of Mount Lebanon, from a quarter to half a mile in width, and stretching a league along the shore. M. Conti‚Äôs garden was on the verge of the sands, and near the spot where we met him. His offer was accordingly thankfully accepted; and, turning in at the orchard gate, in about half an hour our camp arrangements were completed, and Cab√¥or, with his cooking utensils round a gipsy‚Äôs fire, was busily occupied in preparing our supper.</p>
<p>The lovely wife of M. Pierre Gerardin, who had also just returned to her home from Beyrout, astride on a ked√Ωsh,[57] in the space of seven hours, alighted from her horse at the garden-gate, when she learned who was within, and paid us a visit. This lady was married to a son of that Gerardin who had treated us with223 such politic incivility in 1831, and who had since died. She was in the costume of a Syrian lady: her hair hung in strait tresses down her back, and black braids of silk fell intermingled with it, so as seemingly to lengthen it to the bend of her knees. The whole was bespangled with small gold money, called rubiahs, of which there might be two hundred or more; and a band, set with gold money, encircled her head, on a level with her forehead, in the fashion of a diadem: the whole being surmounted by a marone-coloured skull cap, richly embroidered in gold. A cream-coloured gown, open in front, and buttoned only at the waist, disclosed her silk gauze chemise, which overhung her pantaloons of silk brocade, and served as a handkerchief to her neck. Her feet were without stockings, and covered only by a pair of yellow papooches. She was a lively young creature; and, as it is common in the Levant to suppose that European ladies who go in public unveiled must, on that account, have much levity of conduct, she endeavoured to imitate what she fancied to be their manners by an assumed freedom, which certainly shocked the females of our party. Mulberries were brought, and eaten with little pointed wooden picks, not to stain the fingers. When our new friends were gone, we supped or dined, and passed the night beneath224 the tent, bitten most dreadfully by fleas and musquitoes.</p>
<p>July 4.‚ÄîIn the morning I walked into Sayda to see the house destined for us; but it was inconvenient, and was still in the possession of its tenants, a Turkish family; so that the idea of locating ourselves there was abandoned. Then, leaving my family under the tent, I set off for J√¥on, where I arrived about sunset, it being three hours‚Äô ride from Sayda.</p>
<p>Lady Hester Stanhope‚Äôs reception of me was kind and warm, but more serious than it had been in 1830; one would have said it was a welcome, as if I had left her a month before, and had just come back, for she proceeded, as she called it, immediately to business. She told me it would have given her pleasure if I had left my family at Beyrout, for she had no house to offer them; and, from the dreadful effects of the earthquake, which, on the 1st of January of this year, had thrown down or cracked a third of the houses throughout Palestine, it would be difficult for me to find one, if I could not content myself with that which had been fixed upon for us at Sayda.</p>
<p>July 5.‚ÄîThis discussion occupied the whole of the next day; when, towards evening, a letter came from my family to say they were in the greatest trouble225 and fright, and that my presence was required immediately. It was hastily determined, therefore, that I should take them to the convent of St. Elias, (Dayr Mar Elias, as it is called) which had been the first residence of Lady Hester Stanhope when she settled in this country.</p>
<p>July 6.‚ÄîIn the morning I rode down to the tent, and found my whole family in tears, and apparently inconsolable. To understand this, the reader must fancy himself transported from a comfortable and well-furnished home to a distant, half-civilized country, where he does not comprehend a word of the language, and planted under a tent in the outskirts of a city, without bar or bolt, without table or chair, and with nobody for an interpreter of his wants but two servants, one of whom speaks broken French, and even that hardly intelligible, and the other nothing but Arabic. It is true, the ladies of the French vice-consul‚Äôs family paid mine a visit, and assured them there was no danger to be apprehended: but, when I had left them, and had gone up into the mountains, the defiles, ravines, and precipices of which were visible from the tent, it required no very gloomy imagination to conjure up horrors of all sorts.</p>
<p>It so happened that, on the night of my quitting them, a deserter, who expected to be severely bastinadoed226 or shot next morning, made his escape from the barrack prison[58] which overhung the walls of Sayda towards the sea, by letting himself down through a sewer, which emptied itself into the surf. He ran for his life along the seashore, until, seeing a light burning in M. Conti‚Äôs garden, and a tent, he crawled through the hedge of prickly pear in the state he was in, and thought he might find pity, and a temporary hiding-place. A rustling and a noise awoke Mrs. ‚Äî‚Äî, and she saw a man, in a niz√†m dress, wet and filthy, standing at the opening of the tent. Her screams awoke the children, the governess, the cook, the gardener, and Abdhu, who slept in the gardener‚Äôs shed close by. They seized the man, who did not attempt to escape, but told them his story; and as all the lower classes were suffering from the oppressive conscription, and other onerous burthens imposed by Ibrahim Pasha, whose rule they abhorred, they furnished the poor deserter with a little covering, and directed him by a lane, through the gardens, towards the mountains, where he would find holes in the rocks to secrete himself, until he could obtain succour from the peasantry.</p>
<p>It is not extraordinary that such an apparition as this should have frightened them all; for, up to the hour of my return, from ignorance of the language, 227they had hardly comprehended the circumstances that gave rise to it. Entreaties and tears, even then, made it imperative on me to remove them forthwith; and, as the mules had been kept tethered on the ground in readiness for a removal, they were reloaded; and, threading the romantic lanes which wind through the gardens, where lilac-trees, bananas, vines, orange and lemon trees, of extraordinary height, with passionflowers, and other creeping plants, wantoning among the thick foliage, made a delicious shade, we emerged from them at the foot of the mountain. Then, passing the hamlet of Hellal√©ah, where, at the doors of their country bastides,[59] the Khel√°ts and Dub√¢anys, friends of my younger days, stood watching to hail my return among them, whilst the elders pointed to their children, now grown up, that I might notice them, we made a steep descent into a small torrent bed, and, again ascending a rough and zigzag path, reached the elevation on which stands, on a barren and unproductive cliff, the small monastery of Mar Elias Abra, or St. Elias, of the village of Abra, about an hour‚Äôs ride from the gates of Sayda.</p>
<p>Mar Elias had originally been the dwelling of a few monks, who performed the duties of a small chapel attached to it. Being a retired and healthy spot, it was chosen by the Bishop of the Schismatic Greeks (to 228whose see it now belonged) for his residence, and, in 1813, when Lady Hester Stanhope first went to live there, was inhabited by one of his successors to the see, Macarius, who was also Patriarch of Antioch. At the request of the Emir Besh√Ωr, prince of the Druses, the patriarch[60] had given it up to Lady Hester, who lived there five or six years, until she removed to Dar J√¥on. After that time she only occasionally visited it, and, since Miss Williams‚Äôs death, had never been there. General Loustaunau[61] occupied one of the rooms, and an old woman, the widow of Metta, the village doctor, with her son, lived in the lodge, and served as porters.</p>
<p>The injuries caused by the earthquake were very extensive. It seems to have begun somewhere near the sea of Tiberi√†d, burying the town of that name, Suffad, and some others, in ruins, and throwing down or damaging the greater part of the dwellings in every city or village along the coast as far as Beyrout, which latter place did not suffer. The monastery of Mar Elias was shaken to its very foundations; and, on 229taking possession of our new residence, the state it was in sufficiently showed how terrible the terrestrial convulsion had been. General Loustaunau described it to me as follows:‚ÄîHe was sitting under the verandah which runs round a part of the small quadrangle, reading his Bible, when his chair gave a tilt under him. He raised his eyes from his book, and saw the side of the building facing him rock. A cloud of dust immediately rose above the roof. He knew it was an earthquake, but was not, or had not time to be, terrified; for, before he could well think about it, it was over, and he found himself unhurt. He never quitted the spot where he was, until his maid, the porter, and the porter‚Äôs mother, called to him with loud cries. When they came to examine the mischief that had been done, they found the store-room, which was the corner room of the quadrangle to the north-west, entirely fallen in, burying in its ruins more than two hundred weight of copper utensils. The wall of the room which formerly served as Lady Hester Stanhope‚Äôs bed-room, next to the store-room, had peeled from top to bottom‚Äîhalf having fallen, and half being left standing. The kitchen roof had fallen in. In the centre of the quadrangle, the parterre, bordered with oblong freestones, had been raised perpendicularly about two feet, with a zenzeluct tree, the rose-bushes,230 and a palm-tree on it; and so we found them still, the pavement giving a hollow sound to the tread. The arch of the gate of the stable-yard was lifted out of its curve, and the wood-house was down. The room inhabited formerly by Monsieur Beaudin, then her ladyship‚Äôs secretary, and now French vice-consul at Damascus, was a heap of ruins; and numberless rents and partial fissures manifested themselves everywhere. The chapel, General Loustaunau‚Äôs room, the saloon, and another large room of equal size, had escaped entirely, together with the bath, and two or three small rooms adjoining. The beams of what had been Lady Hester‚Äôs bed-room were now propped up by balks of wood; and thus we had three large rooms at our disposal.</p>
<p>Here then I fixed my family; and hiring two women, Tabith√¢ and Hel√¥on, a girl, Werdy, and a boy, Habyb, from the village of Abra, which was about ten minutes‚Äô walk from Mar Elias, as servants, there seemed a prospect of great comfort and tranquillity for us all, whilst I could give my undivided attention to Lady Hester‚Äôs health and affairs, passing my time alternately between the two places.</p>
