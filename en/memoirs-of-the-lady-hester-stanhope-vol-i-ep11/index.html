    <p>chapter x.
Mrs. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äôs unwillingness to remain at Abra after Signora L.‚Äôs death‚ÄîBeyrout fixed on as a residence‚ÄîLady H.‚Äôs account of her debts‚ÄîNecessities to which she was reduced‚ÄîAnother version of her debts‚ÄîHer extensive charities‚ÄîAnecdote of Shaykh Omar-ed-dyn‚ÄîUsurious discount on Lady H.‚Äôs bills of exchange‚ÄîLoss from the fluctuating value of money in the East‚ÄîEstates supposed to have been bequeathed to Lady H.‚ÄîLetters from Lady H. to M. Guys‚ÄîShe employs Sir Francis Burdett to inquire into the nature of the supposed bequests‚ÄîHer opinion of Sir Francis‚ÄîLetter to him‚ÄîLady H.‚Äôs diatribes on women‚ÄîMr. C.‚ÄîLetter to Miss ‚Äî‚Äî ‚ÄîLetter to the Author.</p>
<p>Again the necessity occurs of introducing my personal affairs, in order to keep up the thread of our story. Madame L.‚Äôs melancholy disorder, and its fatal termination, had left such awful impressions on the females of my family, that they expressed an earnest wish to remove from a scene where every object excited some melancholy reflection. It was in vain they were told there was no other house in the country in which they could live so comfortably. Their answer was, that day and night they were295 haunted with the cries and frantic laugh of poor Madame L., and that they would prefer even the most wretched peasant‚Äôs cottage to remaining where they were. They represented also the forlorn state in which they were left during my absence at Lady Hester Stanhope‚Äôs for a week and a fortnight together, having nobody near them for a protector but General Loustaunau, a man now eighty-two years of age, impaired in intellect, and sinking into imbecility.</p>
<p>But Lady Hester had no consideration for all these womanish weaknesses. Her former animosity against Mrs. ‚Äî‚Äî had not abated one jot. She held to our agreement, that my family was to be considered as strangers, with whom she had nothing to do; for, as I had brought them contrary to her wishes, I must look to them myself, without expecting any sympathy from her. I observed to her how much more convenient it would be for all parties if she would only lend me one of the cottages she had empty in the village of J√¥on, which I could fit up for our temporary dwelling, and which, from its proximity, would save me so many journeys to and fro: but, as Cab√¥or had foretold, there was no reconciling these conflicting interests. At last she proposed an arrangement, to which I acceded much against my will, as I knew it would put her to great inconvenience. No news having yet arrived from England respecting the property296 supposed to have been bequeathed to her, she suggested that I should set off with my family to Beyrout or Cyprus, and live there until she had certain advice that money was forthcoming sufficient to pay her debts; when I could easily return and execute those services for her which she required of me. This plan was settled, as it appeared, finally.</p>
<p>In the mean time, Lady Hester had taken advantage of a leisure day to enter into the full particulars of her debts. I will therefore give some account of their origin, and show how it was that she who, during her residence in England after Mr. Pitt‚Äôs death, and during the many years I was with her in Turkey, was one of the most punctual and over-generous payers I ever knew, could have fallen into the opposite extreme, and have thus exposed herself to the degradation of having duns at her gate, and her name in the mouths of the moneyed men at Beyrout as a defaulter.</p>
<p>What I could recollect sufficiently well to write down the same night in Lady Hester‚Äôs own words was as follows:‚Äî‚ÄúAfter the death of M√¢alem Haym,‚Äù said she, ‚Äúthe celebrated Jewish ser√†f or banker to Abdallah Pasha of Acre, by whom he was strangled, all the Jews of the pashalik were amerced. Some of these came to me, and entreated me, for the love of God, to lend them money to satisfy the Pasha‚Äôs extortions, and save them from being bastinadoed, and297 perhaps worse. I was at that time low in purse myself, and could only give them 3,000 piasters, which was all I had. I subsequently lent them more, for which they gave me in payment damaged pieces of cloth, sixpenny pocket-handkerchiefs, and other goods, which of course I could not dispose of except at a ruinous loss. I knew I was cheated by them, but I was too proud to complain.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNot long after this, Abdallah Pasha himself having been declared firmanlee (or outlawed) by the Porte, six pashas, with their combined forces, were sent to besiege him in Acre. Provisions and animals became so scarce, that I was obliged to send people to buy camels in the desert, and then despatch them under the care of a Jew, of whom I had scarcely any knowledge, to buy corn for myself and the house. When at last, and partly by my means, Abdallah Pasha had obtained his pardon from the Porte, but upon condition of paying an immense fine, he pretended to sell his pipes, shawls, carpets, and jewels, to raise the money; for he was, or affected to be, so low in his treasury, that the del√†ls, or auctioneers, were to be seen hawking even his wearing-apparel in the bazar. Among other ways of meeting the demands of the Sultan, he applied to me to lend him as much money as I could possibly raise; and I, not doubting that he would repay me honourably, after drawing for what298 money I had at my disposal in England, applied to a usurious Christian of Beyrout, who, at an exorbitant rate of interest, furnished me with what I required. No sooner was the rate known which I was to pay for what I had borrowed, than Turks, Christians, and Jews, presented themselves with offers of loans to whatever extent I wished, all professing that their purses were at my disposal; that it was beneath a lady of my rank to discuss matters so paltry as money concerns; and that all they required was merely my signature to a scrap of paper, just acknowledging the debt. In this way I signed small bits of paper, it is true, but well and legally worded in Arabic, or Armenian, or Hebrew, which I could not read, and by which I bound myself to pay enormous interest, varying from 25 to 50 per cent.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis was the real beginning of my debts and difficulties; for Abdallah Pasha gave me bills at thirty-one days‚Äô sight on Constantinople, payment of which was deferred under one pretence or another for a year, whilst I, in the interim, was in such want of money, that I was reduced to a single adlee.[70] The worst of all was that, I don‚Äôt think the Pasha wanted it, but only pretended poverty to deceive the Porte. However, in consequence of his failing to repay me at the time agreed on, which repayment would have placed 299me immediately in a state of solvency, I found myself reduced absolutely to destitution. On one occasion, as I said, I was left without a farthing, and M. Loustaunau went off to M. Beaudin, who was at Damascus, and told him that, as he owed his advancement in life in part to me, he was bound to assist me in my extremity. M. Beaudin at first hesitated; M. Loustaunau insisted; and B. lent me 4,000 Spanish dollars, which I afterwards paid him.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut this is not all. I was even obliged to send my best pelisse to be sold or pawned in the bazar at Sayda, and to sell to an Albanian soldier forty English guineas, which my brother had given me on parting at Gibraltar, and which I had saved in the shipwreck.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOh! doctor, about six months before Miss Williams‚Äôs death, I was reduced so low, that, had she died then, I should not have had money enough to bury her. M√¥osa, one of the best servants I ever had, and who died of the same fever that carried off Miss Williams, out of his own pocket bought oil for two or three months‚Äô consumption, without my knowledge; telling Miss W., who afterwards told me, that it was not proper mylady should send for oil by pints and quarts like poor people, which, just then, I was compelled to do. Oh, Lord! when I think of it! One day, when I was walking up and down, not knowing how or where to turn, thinking I must shoot my300 horses from having nothing to feed them with, I heard the jingling of camels‚Äô bells, and presently a servant came to say that there were some camels at the gate laden with barley. This seasonable supply for the horses was sent by some strangers, who had heard the condition I was in; and the last adlee that I had I gave to the camel-driver.‚Äù</p>
<p>Another time, Lady Hester gave me, in writing, a little memorandum of the state of her finances to read, which varies somewhat from her account by word of mouth, although agreeing in the main. It was as follows:</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy debts began in 1822‚Äîfrom 1822 to 1823; and, in a couple of years, I owed ¬£3,000, not that I had actually borrowed that sum. I was obliged to take up money, owing to the revolutions in the country; I speak of the time in which there were three pachas, with an army, encamped before the gates of Acre, and when the Emir Besh√Ωr, the governor of the mountain, had fled to Egypt; and such a number of persecuted people took refuge under my roof, that this caused me great expense. Expecting remittances from England at that time, which I never received, I placed the date of the bonds for the money which I borrowed, for only four and six months, at twenty-five per cent. This, with their interest and compound interest, and the loss upon the money which I was obliged to take at the price they chose301 to give it, amounted in three years to ¬£3,000. Now, God knows what it is! My income would now only simply suffice, after paying the interest of these bonds, to pay my servants and tradespeople, and put a little provision in my house. You must understand that, when I drew for my pension upon Constantinople, I paid the dollars at 6 piasters or 6¬Ω; I received them at Beyrout at 10¬Ω, and repaid them again in the Metouali country and at Sayda, where I got my provisions, at 8¬Ω: therefore, I often lost 100 per cent. The house of Coutts and Co., since old Coutts‚Äôs death, desired me only to draw my drafts upon them through a merchant‚Äôs house at Constantinople, and there was a serious loss and inconvenience to me in doing so.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is the custom of this country, when persons cannot pay their debts, to place them under arrest by quartering soldiers upon them, who help themselves to everything that comes in their way until the debt is paid. I was resolved to submit myself to the custom of the country, rather than allow the interference of the English consul at that time, whom I detested. I thought it would save me the trouble of telling my story, and cast the reflection on the English name which it deserved. As things seemed as if they must come to a crisis, if I had no means afforded me to avoid it, I thought the more unequivocal it was the302 better: for my peace of mind then would not be harassed by the misfortunes of others, when I was a beggar myself. The means by which I should become so carried no reproach with them; therefore, I prepared my mind to submit myself to my fate with them. The only thing that stopped me was, I was waiting for an answer respecting the sale of a reversion; and then, if my application did not succeed, I determined to shoot my mares, that they might never fall into other hands, to part with Miss Williams and the rest of my establishment as soon as possible, and to leave this part of the world to be never more heard of, first putting into the hands of my creditors documents to enable them to get all I possessed into their power, and my pension, if they could: but this counted for nothing, as English justice and liberality would of course have deprived me of that.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSuch were my intentions, founded upon a determination not to make any explanation to my family, or receive any more reproaches; as I had already received enough. Whatever I had to say was to be said to the Americans, among whom I thought of going, that they, at least, might feel convinced that I inherited my grandfather‚Äôs spirit and high sense of honour; for I never have been in the habit of taking half measures.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe number of my servants had been much303 talked of; but as these people often set off, four and five together, in the night, and as several were constantly absent upon leave to look after their families, whilst others were always upon the sick list, giving themselves fevers by over-eating, I could not possibly get on with fewer than I had: for five men here cannot do the work of one in Europe. What are called dragomans and secretaries are a description of persons even worse than the lower class‚Äîthe idlest and most inefficient of human beings.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs for the persecuted people who took refuge at my house, you must have heard, of course, of the revolution in the mountain about 1822. For half a day‚Äôs journey around me, all the inhabitants abandoned their houses to Turkish and Druze soldiers. I remained alone, tormented to death with miserable fugitives. Terrible storms and an unusual fall of snow destroyed a vast number of houses, and I had only two rooms remaining in mine which were at all habitable. Buildings and walls fell, and all the rest were deluged with water. My health, which was very bad, was rendered worse by the uncommon inclemency of the season, as snow has not been known to have fallen in the lower part of the mountain for thirty years. The cattle died of want, and the next harvest could not be got in for want of beasts of burthen.</p>
<p>304</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis was enough, and the rest you may imagine; and if you never heard half of this whilst you were in France, you must always recollect that what passes in the interior is but little known upon the coast; and a consul or a merchant, by his fireside, is little better acquainted with the state of affairs than they are at Marseilles.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAn old Druse had his head chained to his feet, and was thrown into a dungeon. Several villages, like little towns, were burnt, many women killed, and the property of most of my friends totally destroyed; whilst the unfortunate wives of considerable men were hiding themselves in the snow-mountains in disguise, trembling for their infant sons, whose fate, if got hold of, was pretty certain. The two lads, Hanah and Bootroos, and one of whom I had then the greatest confidence in, were constantly wandering about in search of these unhappy fugitives. I will not say any more; you may judge of my feelings and situation.‚Äù</p>
<p>Such was the rough statement Lady Hester gave me. She alludes in it to the persecuted people who took refuge under her roof: but, in her oral communication, she never said a word of having afforded an asylum to almost all the Franks in Sayda, who fled to her residence in a panic after the battle of Navarino, and many of whom she lodged and boarded until they305 could go back in safety: nor of the two hundred wretched beings whom she fed and clothed, housed, and protected, for nearly two years, after the sacking of Acre. She never said a word of her numerous acts of beneficence, nor of the indulgent forbearance she showed even to those who had wronged her. Here is an authentic case, among twenty similar ones which might be cited.</p>
<p>Shaykh Omar ed Dyn, a puritanical Mussulman, who kept a grocer‚Äôs shop in Sayda, was for many years her purveyor and bailiff; and when, for want of money, she had let her account run up to something considerable, he took her note of hand for the amount, and, at the end of the year, dunned her for payment. To quiet him, she gave him a fresh note of hand, which he required should be for double the amount. Then he begged of her a quarter of wheat, then another; then an entire piece of broad cloth; then this thing, then that, until he ultimately paid himself twice over. I well recollect, in 1831, when, one day, I was going down to Sayda, Lady Hester‚Äôs saying to me, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ride the chestnut horse,‚Äù (rather a valuable one) ‚Äúfor, if you do, as you must pass Shaykh Omar‚Äôs shop, he will beg it of me for his son, and I dare not refuse him.‚Äù</p>
<p>This man, on his death-bed‚Äîfor he died some time during my absence‚Äîcalled his wife and children to306 his bedside, and said to them‚Äî‚ÄúThe Syt Mylady owes me a sum of money; you will find her note of hand among my papers: burn it. She has ever been a benefactress to me, and, if I die with a little property, it is from her generosity. You will here promise me never to urge the claim against her; for I have received double and treble its amount at her hands.‚Äù They made solemn asseverations, and, after his death, the eldest son went to Dar J√¥on, and informed Lady Hester Stanhope of their father‚Äôs dying injunctions: often did the widow, too, repeat to her how sacred she held them. But it had come to Lady Hester‚Äôs certain knowledge that, notwithstanding all these professions, the duplicity and ingratitude which mark the natives of the country were exemplified in this instance, as well as in all others; for the widow had preserved the paper, and had twice attempted to sell it, once to an Englishman, and once to a townsman. Notwithstanding this, every year, at the Byr√†m, Lady Hester gave the widow, whom her son‚Äôs extravagance and inactivity in business had again reduced to narrow circumstances, a handsome sum of money.[71]</p>
<p>307Lady Hester‚Äôs exceeding generous and charitable disposition was well known; and she was consequently besieged with tales of distress, with projects of important discoveries, which wanted nothing in the world to put them in motion but money, with secrets that could be entrusted only to her, with presents that were always sure to be paid for at treble their value. Her creditors assailed her with letters, messages, visits; and these she was obliged to silence by payments in part, and increase of interest.</p>
<p>But this was not all. During the Greek revolution, the Mediterranean was so infested by pirates, that it was dangerous for merchants in the Levant to make their remittances to Europe in specie, a state of things which so considerably increased the value of bills of exchange, that they were often bought up at a great premium. Yet, in the face of these notorious facts, Signor ‚Äî‚Äî, a merchant at Beyrout, used to cash many of Lady Hester‚Äôs bills on Messrs. Coutts and Co., of London, or on Messrs. Webb and Co., of Leghorn, at 35, 25, and 20 per cent. discount, when such paper was actually at a premium in the market. Mr. ‚Äî‚Äî took 15, then 10, then 5 per cent. discount. At various periods, likewise, Lady Hester had had severe illnesses. There was no person about her, in whom she could put confidence, but Miss Williams, who was totally unacquainted with pecuniary affairs,308 and, of course, incapable of remedying the mischief, even if her innocent mind and artless character had not prevented her from suspecting it. At one time, Lady Hester had an Armenian steward, who kept his accounts in his own language: at another time, she had a Piedmontese, who went to Beyrout to negociate the bills, and must have known the nature of such transactions. Who can wonder, therefore, if all her concerns proved ruinous to her, surrounded as she was by adventurers and intriguers? Add to this, that various sorts of money are current in Turkey, as many, perhaps, as thirty, all fluctuating in value, and contributing still more to the complication of her distresses. It would hardly have been a matter of wonder, even under ordinary circumstances, that she should have been plunged into embarrassments; but, in the peculiarly perplexing situation in which she was placed, it was unavoidable.</p>
<p>I was witness to her signing a list of her creditors‚Äô names, with the amount of her various responsibilities, at her request, in case, as she said, anything should befall her, that her creditors might know she never had the smallest intention of defrauding them, even of their usurious and unlawful gains. ‚ÄúWhen I get the money,‚Äù she added, ‚ÄúI shall pay them all just double what they lent me, and I think nobody can say that is unjust.‚Äù</p>
<p>309</p>
<p>All her creditors took 25 per cent. for the money they lent. Supposing Lady Hester had not made any difficulty on that head, and was willing to receive pecuniary assistance even at that loss, why nothing could be said about the matter. Gold was the commodity these merchants had to sell, and they made as much of it as they could; but she did not always get what she had bargained for: some of the lenders sent a part of the loan in coffee, rice, and in other merchandize. In most cases, the gold was not of full weight; for never was there a country in which money-clipping is carried on to a greater extent than in Turkey. And it is not fair to say that Jews are the only usurers: Mussulmans and Christians are just as bad, when the law, or other considerations, do not coerce them into honesty. Let us take, as an example, a Christian merchant of Beyrout.</p>
<p>Lady Hester Stanhope wanted to borrow ¬£600; and she applied to Mr. ‚Äî‚Äî, in September, 1826, when the exchange was at 20 piasters the Spanish dollar: ¬£200, consequently, are about equal to 1000 Spanish dollars; and ¬£600 to 3000 or 60,000 Turkish piasters. Her ladyship drew on Messrs. Coutts and Co. for ¬£600, at one year‚Äôs date. The merchant gives her for her bill, instead of 60,000 piasters, only 52,500, that is 17¬Ω for the dollar instead of 20, which was the real exchange: he gains310 at once on the transaction, 7500 piasters, or ¬£75. But the bill has a year to run: he, therefore, demands a bonus for his risk, and modestly requires 1000 dollars, or ¬£200; and Lady Hester at last receives ¬£325 for her ¬£600. This sum is paid in adlees of 16 piastres, ghazis of 20, roobeyas of 9, and sundry other current moneys; but, a week or two afterwards, the pasha issues a tariff, fixing a lower value than the current one on all the coinage of the empire, a step customary every year just before the taxes are gathered, by which the government gains a considerable increase of revenue. This is known to the merchant beforehand, who, having on his books a memorandum of the customary rates at which the money is annually set, or, which is more likely, having, for a consideration, obtained private information from the government secretaries what money will be rated lowest, takes care to make his rouleaus consist of what he is most desirous of ridding himself of: and Lady Hester finds that what she has received at 20 will only pass at 17¬æ, those at 9 only at 8¬º, and so on; by which another serious loss is added to all the rest. But in August, 1837, her bill is delayed payment because Messrs. Coutts and Co. have not the certificate of her life for Michaelmas of that year, (delayed, probably, in consequence of Lord Palmerston‚Äôs measures) and she is compelled to ask time for six months more,311 which is granted on her signing a promissory note for an additional number of dollars in the same usurious proportion.</p>
<p>After this statement of her debts, Lady Hester next proceeded to explain how it was she had written to me in such haste to come over to Syria. It has already been mentioned that, in 1836, she had been informed, by one of her friends in England, that a considerable estate had been bequeathed to her, the knowledge of which was concealed from her by those privy to the bequest.</p>
<p>The beginning of this erroneous belief seems to date from the spring of 1836. In some letters which passed about that time between her ladyship and the Chevalier Henry Guys, French consul at Beyrout, which that gentleman kindly allows me to make use of, and which will best explain her feelings on the subject, it will be seen that she entertained no doubt on the subject, and was firmly persuaded that her friends, for the purpose of forcing her to come to England, kept her in ignorance of her good fortune, thinking that distress must eventually drive her back to her native country. These letters were transmitted to me at Nice, after my manuscript had been sent to England; but the narrative will suffer no interruption by their introduction here, and they serve to corroborate many portions of it.</p>
<p>312</p>
<p>Lady H. Stanhope to the Chevalier Henry Guys, French
Consul at Beyrout.</p>
<p>Translated from the French.</p>
<p>[No date.]</p>
<p>Monsieur,</p>
<p>A thousand and a thousand pardons for having delayed so long sending you the bills of exchange; but Logmagi has put off his journey to Beyrout from day to day, and I too have been in such a bad humour that I could not write.</p>
<p>After I had given Yuness the letters, I received one from Sayda, from my Lord H******** written in such an agitated manner, that it cost me two days to make it out. The date of it is the 1st of September; then this date is scratched out, and the month of December is put. He tells me that ‚Äúhe went directly to get correct information about my money matters, and that they excused themselves by saying, that sometimes they did not know whether I was alive, which was the reason of their being behind in their payments,‚Äù &amp;c., and such b√™tises. About the other affair, he writes nothing at all, only that he gives me to understand, if I wish everything to go on well and as I desire, I must return to England, and then there will be such fine doings, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>313</p>
<p>All this does not make me change my mind, but it delays everything. If they won‚Äôt do me justice, they shall be made to do it by force‚Äîby the law. Have the goodness to put the enclosed letter to my Lord H********, under cover to Coutts and Co., with a life certificate, for fear the bills of exchange should not be presented soon enough. Now that I enjoy a little quiet, I shall settle all these matters, and all will do well, I hope, in the end; but the excessive folly and blindness of those people astonish me, and make me angry, because they place me in a very awkward situation, where I must either be deprived of what is due to me, or hurt their reputations. If this business becomes known in England, it will make a great noise.</p>
<p>After having well examined my account, I find I have got left about 400 and odd pounds sterling. Out of the ¬£700, you have ¬£400, or thereabouts, in hand. Make up a bag of 1000 dollars clear; keep 200 gazi for things I shall want‚Äî(Yusef Bout√†l, of Alexandria, will have a bill of about 2000 piasters, which I will thank you, in due time, to pay)‚Äîgive the rest to Logmagi for commissions, and send me by him some fresh bills of exchange for the ¬£400 sterling.</p>
<p>God grant that the time may come, when I shall have it in my power to return you, in some shape, a314 small measure only of the politeness and attention I have received from you.</p>
<p>Be assured, Monsieur, of my esteem and friendship.</p>
<p>Hester Lucy Stanhope.</p>

<p>May 29, King Charles‚Äôs day.</p>
<p>Two words more, Monsieur, for Dr. ‚Äî‚Äî, and a letter for Messrs. Coutts, which be good enough to forward. According to the report of a Greek captain, it appears that a cousin of mine, my lord N***** after having stopped a day or two at Cyprus, is gone to the Carimanian coast, with the intention of coming here afterwards. I hope he will not come to disturb me in all I have got to say to you. He is brother of the D‚Äî‚Äî of B‚Äî‚Äî, that man who always thwarts me in all my concerns, in the hope of making me quit this country by compulsion. The father of this D‚Äî‚Äî of B‚Äî‚Äî spent for the Bourbons, all the time they were in England, ¬£25,000 a-year.</p>
<p>Logmagi has brought me the 6,000 piasters, which you have had the goodness to advance me. We will settle all that on your arrival here. In the mean time, monsieur, accept a thousand thanks, and the assurance of my friendship.</p>

<p>[No date, but supposed to be June, 1836.]</p>
<p>Monsieur,</p>
<p>I am disposed always to put full confidence in you: here is Coutts‚Äôs account, such as it is. The letter says nothing‚Äîonly that so much money has been paid in by such a one, probably an agent of my brother‚Äôs son; but of that I am not sure. Send me back the account when you have any one coming here. No doubt I owe the payment of this sum to Lord Hardwicke, who does not write until he has finished it all. He is a man who has rendered me a thousand services, without ever having made them known to me: but chance has brought them to my knowledge. Wait‚Äîhave a little patience: God is great, and I have right on my side.</p>
<p>Tell me if there are any opportunities for Leghorn or France: I wish to write to the Doctor.</p>
<p>Monday se‚Äônnight.</p>
<p>Mansoor is going to Beyrout to do some commissions; but he has such a bad memory, that I shall be no gainer by his going in what I have to say to you. I am in want of a drawing for two ceilings (one for my div√†n-room,) after your taste and ideas, composed of a circle in the centre and a cornucopia at each corner; the remainder a trellis. There must be also small316 arcades. These I should like to be ornamented with fel√°k[72] flowers (I don‚Äôt know the French name); the circular centre may have ears of corn, roses, pomegranates‚ÄîI mean chiefly. My idea of a cornucopia you will see in the annexed sketch.</p>
<p>I have just this moment received a very long letter from Madame de F√©riat, who is delighted with the permission I have given her to come to me. She is making her preparations, is selling her property, &amp;c. I fancy she must be a woman quite unique.</p>
<p>I will write again on Sunday; but, before you let me hear from you, will you make some inquiries about the character of a Florentine who has written to me. Let me know what kind of a man he is; what he is good for. I can never get through all my business with Mansoor alone; still those Franks are generally detestable. His name is Renecucci, or something like it. Forgive me for troubling you so much, and accept, monsieur, the sentiments of my regard and respect.</p>
<p>Hester Lucy Stanhope.</p>
<p>Friday, 3 o‚Äôclock.</p>
<p>My express goes off now.</p>
<p>For the div√†n-room of Madame F., I should like 317ornaments of a musical character, flowers, &amp;c.; for she seems to be very fond of music and the fine arts.</p>
<p>Let me know whether the Spanish carpenter is out of employ just at present.</p>
<p>The same to the same.</p>
<p>Djoun, June 18, 1836.</p>
<p>Monsieur,</p>
<p>Your letter came to hand the 17th, in the evening, and it is with pleasure that I see the extent of the interest you are good enough to take in my affairs. Therefore, you will be pleased to learn that what I intended to do will, probably, be no longer necessary.</p>
<p>Very extraordinary circumstances have come to my knowledge, which I cannot communicate to you by letter.</p>
<p>I am neither afraid of plague nor of anything else; so if you believe, as I do, that everything is destiny, I should like to have an opportunity of profiting by your counsel touching certain things somewhat incredible, which have been twice repeated to me by persons much attached to me, but who are desirous of not being known.</p>
<p>Now I must speak to you about my money concerns. In the course of fifteen or twenty days, I should like318 to have three letters of exchange for 1000 dollars. If you have not the money by you, you can give the bills to some of the English merchants, with whom I will not have anything to do, because they wish to have all my bills or none at all; and, as I see that my affairs are likely to be bettered, I shall have nobody but you. You served me well in my misfortunes, and I wish you to see the end of them. As I fear my letters may be stopped,[73] if my handwriting were known, I will thank you to direct one of them to Mr. A. Kinglake, adding the name of your banker at Paris or Marseilles. I have left that one open: you will be good enough to seal it, and put it, as well as the other to My lord Hardwicke, under cover, directed to one of your friends in England.</p>
<p>Adieu, monsieur, and pray accept the assurance of my esteem and friendship.</p>
<p>Hester Lucy Stanhope.</p>
<p>PS. I have kept back my letter a day longer, having had an express from Beyrout, to inform me that a medallion, belonging to me, has been found at Cyprus‚Äîanother proof of the robberies committed in 319my house. However, for the present, say nothing about it, until they have caught the man who sold it.</p>
<p>The original letter is annexed, as a specimen of her ladyship‚Äôs French.</p>
<p>Djoun, le 18 Juin, 1836.</p>
<p>Monsieur,</p>
<p>Votre lettre m‚Äôa √©t√© remise le 17 au soir; et c‚Äôest avec plaisir que je vois l‚Äô√©tendue de l‚Äôint√©r√™t que vous avez la bont√© de prendre dans mes affaires. Vous serez ainsi content d‚Äôapprendre que ce que je voulois faire ne sera peut-√™tre plus n√©cessaire. J‚Äôai appris des circonstances tr√®s extraordinaires, dont je ne pourrais vous faire part par lettre. Je ne crains ni peste ni rien autre: ainsi, si vous croyez, comme moi, que tout est √©crit, je voudrois bien avoir l‚Äôoccasion de profiter de vos lumi√®res touchant des choses un peu incroyables, mais qui m‚Äôout √©t√© deux fois r√©p√©t√©es par des personnes qui me sont fort attach√©es, mais qui d√©sirent de ne pas se faire conn√¥itr√©.</p>
<p>A-pr√©sent, il faut vous parler de mes affaires d‚Äôint√©r√™t. Dans le courant de 15 √† 20 jours, je voudrois trois lettres de change pour 1000 talaris. Si vous n‚Äôavez pas l‚Äôargent chez vous, vous pouvez donner des lettres √† quelqu‚Äôun de ces Anglois, avec lesquels je n‚Äôaime pas me m√™ler, parcequ‚Äôils veulent320 avoir toutes mes lettres de change ou point: mais comme je vois que mes affaires vont se bien r√©tablir, je ne veux que vous. Vous m‚Äôavez bien servi dans le malheur, et j‚Äôaime que vous voyez la fin.</p>
<p>Comme je crains que l‚Äôon arr√™te peut-√™tre mes lettres, si mon √©criture est connue, je vous prie d‚Äôen adresser une √† Monsieur A. Kinglake, en ajoutant le nom de votre banquier √† Paris ou √† Marseille. Je l‚Äôai laiss√© ouverte. Vous la cacheterez et vous la mettrez, ainsi que l‚Äôautre √† Mylord Hardwicke, sous enveloppe, adress√©e √† un de vos amis en Angleterre.</p>
<p>Adieu, monsieur, je vous ai beaucoup fatigu√©; mais pardonnez moi, et agreez l‚Äôassurance de mon estime et de mon amiti√©.</p>
<p>Hester Lucy Stanhope.</p>
<p>PS. J‚Äôai gard√© ma lettre un jour, ayant re√ßu un messager de Beyrout, qui me parle d‚Äôune m√©daille trouv√©e √† Chypre qui m‚Äôappartient, autre preuve des voleurs dans ma maison. Mais √† present, il ne faut rien dire jusqu‚Äô√† ce que l‚Äôon ait attrap√© celui qui l‚Äôa vendue.</p>
<p>J‚Äôai fait une b√™tise. J‚Äôai adress√© la lettre. Mes id√©es sont toutes sur la m√©daille.</p>

<p>The same to the same.</p>
<p>Djoun, July 3, 1836.</p>
<p>Monsieur,</p>
<p>I intended to have written to you yesterday, when your letter reached me, to have told you that I have found out still more robberies, and such intrigues!‚Äîbut say nothing for the present: only, I foresee, I shall be put to great expense every way; and, if it does not inconvenience you to wait for the amount of the bill that was protested, until the ¬£2,000 are paid into your bankers‚Äô hands, it would considerably advance my business.</p>
<p>I have had farther accounts about the money concealed from me. Very good! When I get it, I shall give you plenty of commissions for France.</p>
<p>How kind you are to think about my eyesight, which sickness and trouble have so injured! Nevertheless, it is better than it was last year.</p>
<p>I will send you back the book by the express who will go for the money. What day would you like he should be with you? Half of what the writer says is incorrect.[74] Before I went to Palmyra, I made an excursion 322into the Desert with Lascaris alone, keeping the doctor and the married servants, under one pretext or another, from accompanying me. Lascaris and I were pursued by the Fed√¢an Bedouins, who were hostile to Mohammed el Fadi; and, although our horses never drank for two days, we rode from ten in the morning until after midnight, without eating or drinking, to get out of their district. Then, again, the dispute between Lascaris and me was about a groom, who, not knowing who he was, would not let him enter my stables at Hamah. His pride would not stop to listen to reason, and he ran away (et il s‚Äôest enfuit). I met him several years afterwards at Tripoli, and he made me cry for an hour by the excess of his grief, and the excuses which he made me: so much so, that I, who hardly ever shed tears, was astonished at myself. Poor man! There, indeed, was a true courtier, with the most elegant manners, and an inconceivable fund of knowledge, without pedantry. It was not Napoleon that he was so much attached to; it was to him who had the portefeuille. You know very well what he did for him.</p>
<p>Accept, monsieur, the expression of my esteem and regard.</p>
<p>Hester Lucy Stanhope.</p>
<p>323</p>
<p>The same to the same.</p>
<p>Djoun, August 14, 1836.</p>
<p>Monsieur,</p>
<p>I have succeeded, at last, in finding out the extent of the intrigues against me. The intriguers thought to do me a great deal of harm, but, thank God! they have done me a great deal of good, as you will see hereafter. When the hot days are over, you must pay me another visit, in order for me to make you perfectly acquainted with everything, and also to settle our accounts. Be not uneasy if you do not receive any letters from your correspondent by the packet-boat. At this season, all the great folks in England are dispersed at their country-houses, and your friend, perhaps, will defer writing to you until he gets your last letters.</p>
<p>I have as yet no answer from the doctor since I last wrote to him, but I understand his circumstances are not very flourishing. Poor man, let him take courage: he shall be better, ay, shall be well off, when I have put down those ‚Äî‚Äî.</p>
<p>In eight days, with your leave, I will send you the bill of exchange for the ¬£100, and you can send me the 200 gazi.[75] I sha‚Äôn‚Äôt torment you any more afterwards, 324until I make you my principal banker and attorney, to liquidate my debts, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Accept, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Hester Lucy Stanhope.</p>
<p>PS. The negro affair has not annoyed me much, but the infamous conduct of those two maids torments me daily. One of them has driven her father-in-law from his home, and the other has been turned out of doors by the man‚Äôs wife where she lived. I have always found that giving too much education was only painting a character over, and that, needs must, whatever is born in man will, sooner or later, show itself. Too much education is what has spoiled France, and has made the French monkey-philosophers, and the English wicked brutes (qui a rendu les Fran√ßois des singes philosophes et les Anglois des m√©chantes b√™tes).</p>
<p>The same to the same.</p>
<p>October, 1836.</p>
<p>Monsieur,</p>
<p>I cannot but think how kind you are to me, not even to forget my business, when the presence of such a distinguished personage[76] requires all your 325attention: but you are equal to it all. Would to Heaven that the Prince was aware how much France owes you! Indeed, he cannot fail of knowing it during his cruise in the Levant, where everybody esteems you so much: but I must hold my tongue, else you may be angry with me.</p>
<p>Have the goodness to deliver the money sealed up to Yuness. Enclosed are the bills of exchange, and the letter which you allowed me to read.</p>
<p>The same to the same.</p>
<p>Djoun, October 30, 1836.</p>
<p>Monsieur,</p>
<p>Hardly was I recovered from my migraine and inflammation in my eyes, when, lo! all my people fall ill‚Äîthe little black girl and all‚Äîand I have been tormented and tired to death: but, thank God, they are now all well again!</p>
<p>I have delayed writing to you, expecting always to have letters by the steamer; but, when I reflect on it, I doubt if I shall receive any until Parliament meets‚Äîat least, that will be the excuse, and they will say that everybody is just now out of town.</p>
<p>It will be curious to see how they will prove their right to conceal from me that money had been left me. I understand clearly that there are two legacies (one I326 have been informed of by an indirect, but a very certain channel, since I saw you); a considerable one and a small one. If I were spiteful, I could make them repent of their doings in a court of justice: but, even as it is, the matter cannot be passed over without creating some noise in the world.</p>
<p>I have twice advised Mr. Coutts that I should draw on him, after the 10th of October, both for my pension and the ¬£950 which fell due in September; and, after the repeated assurances which they have made, that, in future, they will be punctual in their payments, I can‚Äôt think they will play me any more tricks, especially when they will have so much to do for me since the discovery which I have made. Therefore, will you let me know if you have money enough by you to cash a bill of ¬£300, before the money from England comes to hand. Of that amount, I wish you to keep 200 gazi for expenses.</p>
<p>Lady Hester now told me that, having written ineffectually to a nobleman on the subject, she had turned over in her thoughts where she could find a fit person, in whom she could confide, to ascertain the truth of these matters, and to whom she could write, with the request that he would make the necessary inquiries. She had deliberated a long while whether327 it should be a lawyer, a man of business, or one of her old friends. Among the latter, from first to last, she added, ‚ÄúI have thought Sir Francis Burdett would be the one I could most assuredly confide in.‚Äù In speaking of him, she said, ‚ÄúHe is a man of feeling, doctor, and he and I were always the best of friends. I recollect, when I told him how basely two or three people had behaved on Mr. Pitt‚Äôs death, he was ready to go beside himself: his hand went into the breast of his waistcoat and out again, as if he could not contain his indignation. What do you think?‚Äîwould not he be the proper person? I always said Sir Francis was no democrat. He threw himself into the hands of the people merely that he might have an excuse of business to be out, or by himself. All the democrats that I have known were nothing but aristocrats at heart‚Äîay, and worse than others. Even Horne Tooke was not a democrat‚Äîthat I am sure of, by the court he always paid me, and by his constantly making so many civil speeches to me and of me. I have never known a man yet, if he was not to be bought, that was not a democrat from personal motives.‚Äù</p>
<p>In fine, it was resolved to write to Sir Francis, and a rough copy of a letter was drawn up by Lady Hester‚Äôs dictation, which, after some verbal alterations, she thought would do. Several remarks, quite foreign to the subject, were introduced, announcing the researches328 she had made as to the Eastern origin of the Irish and Scotch; and, as Lady Hester kept constantly saying to me, ‚ÄúWill this letter do? do you see anything that wants altering?‚Äù a question very usual with her when dictating letters, I forgot Gil Blas‚Äôs warning, and very distinctly expressed my apprehensions lest the introduction of the opinions about the affinity of the Irish and the Kore√Ωsh should make Sir F. think her cracked. For, I observed, his studies, most probably, have never led him to investigate these subjects, which, thus introduced into a letter on business, might be made a handle for the ill-natured comments of people who disliked her. She thanked me, but retained them all, and only requested me to write them out fair. I did so, and inadvertently skipped a page, which, when the sheet was full, created some confusion in reading it. So, resolving to rewrite it, I merely submitted it to Lady Hester‚Äôs perusal, whilst I rode down to see my family. But I was there seized with a phlegmonous inflammation of my leg, which, in one night, from the irritation of the stirrup-leather (rudely made, as it always is in Turkey), assumed so alarming a character,[77] and was so painful, that I took to my bed and kept it eleven days. I wrote a note to Lady 329Hester, describing my situation, requesting her to send me the letter to Sir F. in order that I might write it over again: but, hearing that I suffered a great deal, she said it was not necessary; and, sealing the copy she had got, she despatched it by a foot-messenger to Beyrout to go by the steamboat.</p>
<p>September 12.‚ÄîWe were thus occupied until this day, with the exception of the many hours passed by Lady Hester in diatribes on women and their husbands; she endeavouring to prove that, in almost all possible cases, women should be simple automatons, moved by the will and guidance of their masters. Her fertile memory brought a vast number of cases to bear on her argument; cases which she had seen in high life during her time, where gentlemen, otherwise of estimable character, became the ridicule of society from suffering themselves to be ruled by their wives. But Lord F. was the one whose example she dwelt upon most strenuously.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWomen,‚Äù she would say, ‚Äúmust be one of three things. Either they are politicians and literary characters; or they must devote their time to dress, pleasure, and love; or, lastly, they must be fond of domestic affairs. I do not mean by domestic affairs a woman who sits working at her needle, scolding a couple of children, and sending her maid next door to the shop for all she wants: there is no trouble in that.330 What I mean is a yeoman‚Äôs wife, who takes care of the butter and cheese, sees the poultry-yard attended to, and looks to her husband‚Äôs comfort and interest. As for the advantage of passing your evenings with your family, which you urge as a reason for having them near you,‚Äù she remarked, ‚Äúall sensible men that I have ever heard of take their meals with their wives, and then retire to their own room to read, write, or do what they have to do, or what best pleases them. If a man is a fox-hunter, he goes and talks with his huntsmen or the grooms, and very good company they are; if he is a tradesman, he goes into his shop; if a doctor, to his patients; but nobody is such a fool as to moider away his time in the slip-slop conversation of a pack of women.‚Äù[78]</p>
<p>I happened to observe that many clever men had not only passed their hours with their families, but 331even studied and wrote surrounded by them; and I named four or five that occurred to my recollection, one of whom was C‚Äî‚Äî. ‚ÄúDid you ever hear me say there were not more fools than one in the world?‚Äù‚ÄîShe rejoined, ‚ÄúAs for Mr. C‚Äî‚Äî, I knew him; so you need not talk to me about him. Mrs. C‚Äî‚Äî! there was a woman!‚ÄîCharles C. was one of the greatest rou√©s in London‚Äîalways drunk. He was in the Blues, and took it into his head to fall in love with a Rt. Hble.‚Äîvery ugly‚Äîbut her relations would not let her marry him. Perhaps he wanted her money; he was very agreeable. Mr. C. lived in a very hugger-mugger sort of a way, with a maid of all work and a boy, and it was his daughter who did most things for him. Perhaps he was not rich enough to have another room to study in.‚Äù</p>
<p>In this sort of way would Lady Hester Stanhope argue on most subjects, running from one thing to another, and then, when you thought she had lost sight of her text, returning to it with some pithy observation, which generally settled the point to her own satisfaction.</p>
<p>September 29.‚ÄîI remained at Mar Elias, confined with my bad leg, from the 13th until this day, when I returned to J√¥on. Letters and messengers had, in the interim, been passing between M. Guys and Lady Hester Stanhope respecting a house which he332 was employed to hire for me and my family; but I had reason to think afterwards that she had no wish to get rid of us, as the house was reserved for the Baroness de F√©riat, and the correspondence could tend to no other purpose than to throw odium upon Mrs. ‚Äî‚Äî as a discontented and capricious woman.</p>
<p>During my confinement, Lady Hester Stanhope wrote the following letter to my daughter, then hardly out of her childhood.</p>
<p>To Miss ‚Äî‚Äî</p>
<p>Tuesday, before sunset, Sept. 19th, 1837.</p>
<p>I was pleased to find, my dear little Eugenia, that you inherit your father‚Äôs good-will towards me. I must thank you and Mademoiselle Longchamp for your kind offers of assistance, but I must decline them, having taken a determination not to have anything more to do with the doctor‚Äôs family than if it did not exist in the country. I should forget my situation and rank in life were I to condescend to dispute and make daily explanations to my inferiors. To avoid this, I must give up all thoughts of making your acquaintance, although you are an object of interest to me, as would be all the children of the doctor, even if he had a hundred. Request him not to think about my letters or anything else that relates to me; only let him take care of his health.333 If I can be useful to a sick person, nothing is unpleasant to me; but, when I cannot, or rather am not, permitted to be, the history of the progress of sores is not very agreeable. I do not wish to hear of him till he is recovered. Writing must fatigue him, and I would rather be without letters from you or him.</p>
<p>I have had a letter from M. Guys to-day, in which he tells me he was thinking of taking a ride to see some houses to hire for your family. I shall send to Beyrout on Thursday before daylight, and the doctor‚Äôs letters will go by that messenger. He had better write a few lines more to M. Guys, to explain what situation and what sort of a house he would like, as it would appear that I am grown a fool in my old age, and neither know my right hand from my left.</p>
<p>The doctor is aware that he may command anything my house contains which may be useful to him; but I shall neither send him anything, nor inquire after him, as my messenger was thus ill received:[79] and I do not think I can be called upon to put my eyes out by writing, when I more than want the sight I have left for my own affairs.</p>
<p>Believe me, dear little girl, yours sincerely,</p>
<p>H. L. S.</p>
<p>334The frame of Lady Hester‚Äôs mind at this period may be further understood from the following letter, which was sent to me, with a secret injunction to read it to my wife.</p>
<p>To Dr. ‚Äî‚Äî, at Mar Elias.</p>
<p>Dj√¥on, Sept. 23, 1837.</p>
<p>Whilst waiting for M. Guys‚Äô answer, I have some remarks to make, worthy of your attention. I do not speak in wrath, my dear doctor, but I do not see how, at this period, you are to help yourself; and it is plain to perceive that you will not be able in any way to accomplish the objects you came for. Therefore, I should deem it as an act of folly to stick you up as a sort of maskara[80] in the public eye at Beyrout, merely to write a few letters. The whole of my business M. Guys offered to undertake before I sent for you, and to come here and write for me; but I had reasons for wishing you to come, which no longer exist; for under no circumstances do I see that you would be comfortable near me, nor should I wish for it, either at present or in future. Therefore, if you like to pass the winter at Cyprus, where, perhaps, you would be more comfortable than at Beyrout, you are at full liberty to do so. When my affairs are settled, you 335might then, if Cyprus pleases you, purchase a little terre there, or return to Europe, as you like best.</p>
<p>I am very glad that you wrote to M. Guys yourself; for I had described a country-house near some village, and you have described a sort of coffee-house near the gate of the town. You talked to me of Mrs. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äôs great love of retirement (which I laughed at, at the time,) and therefore she chooses a house upon the high road. But leave all that childish vulgar stuff; I do not wish for a hasty answer, as this subject requires reflection. Try and make yourself comfortable, and I shall find means of settling my business to my satisfaction; only I must have a clear and distinct answer, that I may make arrangements accordingly.</p>
<p>Your sincerely,</p>
<p>Hester Lucy Stanhope.</p>
<p>PS. Should my messenger retard, it is for M. Guys to be able to answer your letter about the house. I enclosed your two letters to be forwarded to England. Do not fidget yourself about me. I have made many awful sacrifices in my life; surely I can make a small one, when I know what it is. This is what distinguishes the truly great from the low and vulgar.</p>
<p>On returning to the Dar, I remained there eight days. Our conversations turned principally, during336 this period, on her father‚Äôs seat at Chevening, the people in that neighbourhood, and the happiness of her early days there. She recollected the names of all the gentry thereabouts, of the farmers, as also of her father‚Äôs servants, and could tell anecdotes respecting them with such a minuteness of particulars, that the individuals, to their surprise, after the lapse of so many years, would have found she remembered more of them than they did of themselves.</p>

<p>[78]A great philosopher reasoned on this point like Lady Hester. According to him: ‚ÄúLa femme et le mari sont bien destin√©s √† vivre ensemble, mais non pas de la m√™me mani√®re; ils doivent agir de concert, sans faire les m√™mes choses. La vie qui charmeroit l‚Äôun seroit insupportable √† l‚Äôautre; les inclinations que leur donne la nature sont aussi diverses que les fonctions qu‚Äôelle leur impose: leurs amusemens ne diff√©rent pas moins que leurs devoirs; en un mot, tous deux concourent au bonheur commun par des chemins differens, et ce partage de travaux et de soins est le plus fort lien de leur union.‚Äù‚ÄîLet. xiv. 3me partie Nouv.

ADDITIONAL NOTES.</p>
<p>Page 78-87‚ÄîThe Emir Besh√Ωr.</p>
<p>In relating these conversations, which place the character of the Emir Besh√Ωr in so disadvantageous a light, it would be unfair not to call the attention of the reader to a work recently published (Memoirs of a Babylonian Princess), in which the Emir is held up as a model of all Christian virtues, and his reign as a reign of peace.</p>
<p>As a romance, the Memoirs of the Princess may challenge a comparison with many works of our best novelists. The authoress seems to have a most unbounded indulgence for the errors of others; but the Emir Besh√Ωr, notwithstanding, must still be left with all his stains upon him, as a wily, sanguinary, and perfidious, but successful prince.</p>
<p>It is not pretended that Lady Hester Stanhope did not personally dislike the Emir Besh√Ωr; and, as her hatreds were as cordial as her friendships, she never spared him when she spoke of him to others, whilst her language, no doubt, was at all times highly coloured: but, unhappily, there are too many notorious facts to justify the abuse she lavishes on him, as regards his cruelties; only, if it is any palliation of his conduct that he had to deal with chieftains who were as338 great adepts in machiavelism as himself, this excuse is conceded to him.</p>
<p>In vol. ii., p. 160, the Amira Asmar informs her readers that the Emir Besh√Ωr had put his two nephews to death to punish their treason in attempting his downfall. Now everybody in Mount Lebanon knows that the nephews had their eyes put out, and, as it was affirmed, were subjected to the loss of organs equally dear to Oriental husbands with sight itself, but were not put to death, and possibly are living now.</p>
<p>In vol. ii., p. 158, we read, ‚ÄúThe Emir had been in power forty years, and, by the firmness and liberality of his policy, had continued, during the long period, to consolidate the jarring and heterogeneous elements committed to his sway into something like a united body; insomuch that peace reigned in the mountain, and the Moslem thirsted not for the blood of his Christian fellow-subject. In short, Maronite, Motowli, Mahometan, and Druze, looked upon each other as brethren.‚Äù A little before this (vol. ii., p. 140), she tells us, ‚ÄúI was at length under the protection of a prince whose vigorous arm upheld the dignity of Christianity in the East, and bid its followers confess their God without fear.‚Äù</p>
<p>In another place (vol. ii., p. 187), we read, ‚ÄúSoon afterwards Lady Hester Stanhope rose, and, bidding us farewell, took her departure, attended by a large retinue. A spirited charger stood at the gate, champing the bit with fiery impatience. She put her foot in the stirrup, and, vaulting nimbly into the saddle, which she, after the Oriental fashion, bestrode like a man, started off at a rapid pace, galloping over rock and mountain.‚Äù</p>
<p>339</p>
<p>Vol. ii., page 203, will afford us one quotation more; and, whilst it must be a matter of regret to raise a doubt of the correctness of the Amira‚Äôs recollections, it still will be necessary to vindicate the present publication from being the vehicle of falsehoods. It is there said, ‚ÄúThe Queen of Tadmor, as Lady Hester Stanhope was commonly called by all the Bedouin tribes, was on the most friendly terms with the Emir Besh√Ωr and his family, and a constant visitant to the garden.‚Äù</p>
<p>It will be in our power to answer all these somewhat erroneous assertions, by relating the substance of a conversation with Lady Hester, not embodied in the text. The conversation was as follows:‚Äî</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat would you say, Doctor, if a monster should send his executioner to tear your little girl, Eugenia, from you, and put her to death? what would be your horror? Yet the Emir Besh√Ωr was capable of this; for when the wretched and unfortunate wife of the Sheykh Besh√Ωr was flying from the terrors that surrounded her, he issued an order that her boy should be torn asunder wherever found. I was by no means intimate or attached to that woman; but her misfortunes required that I should assist her, and humanity justified it, as she was, at the time, without a parra, and flying through the snow. She had four or five children, two of which were in prison at Acre with the father, (who was afterwards strangled there, as you know,) and one was suckling at her breast.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Emir will never forget or forgive what I did on that occasion; for with Hanah‚Äù (this was a poor blind peasant, about whom I had been speaking, and the mention of whom led to the conversation) ‚Äúand another, who were but lads then, I thwarted all his detestable plans, although he had his myrmidons in all340 directions out in search of her. Hanah was nearly lost in the snow, and the effect of the glare on his sight he never recovered. Most people called me a fool for my pains, and trembled at the consequences for me in opposing a powerful prince; but I am not one of your quiet sort, who sit in a corner, and grunt and lament, because they are afraid to act. Humanity raised her voice, that I should endeavour to rescue these wretched orphans, and I did it. With the intrigues of these two rivals, the Emir and the Sheykh, I never meddled: I have never seen the one or the other since the death of Sulym√†n Pasha.‚Äù Now Sulym√†n Pasha died before 1822, consequently Lady Hester Stanhope could not have been intimate with the Emir, nor have mounted her horse at his gate subsequent to 1825, which, if my recollection serves me (for I copied the quotations and returned the book), is the date of the Amira‚Äôs anecdotes.</p>
<p>Page 106.‚Äî‚ÄúThe room bore no resemblance.‚Äù</p>
<p>In perusing these pages, the reader is requested to bear constantly in mind the distinction there is between the usages of the East and those of England. Reflections and observations, if made on some of the incidents in this work, which would apply with irresistible truth in our own country and would necessarily have much weight attached to them, fall still-born from the pen in relation to Orientals. This reservation is called for more particularly in reference to the scenes which pass in Lady Hester Stanhope‚Äôs bed-chamber.</p>
<p>At the word bed-chamber we naturally figure to ourselves a four-post bedstead with tester and curtains, with paillasse, mattress, and feather bed, with marseilles quilt, and perhaps341 an eider-down one upon that, with a marble dressing-table and lavabou, and an endless display of rouge-pots, combs, hair-brushes, and the paraphernalia of a fashionable toilet-table. With one breath all this must be blown to the winds; Turkish ladies never know even the existence of such things. Some cupboard in a corner, or some brass-nailed box, contains whatever they want for cosmetical purposes, and a visit to the bath supplies all the rest.</p>
<p>In Eastern countries there is no room bearing even the name of bed-room; for there are no fixed bedsteads, no fixed washing-stands, no fixed dressing-tables. Every room is a saloon; and, when night comes, from a recess or niche in the thick walls of their houses, covered by a curtain, is drawn forth a wool mattress with a sheet, which are spread on the floor-matting. Upon this ready couch the lovely daughters of those favoured regions throw themselves dressed (let not this be lost sight of‚Äîdressed) very much in the same clothes as in the day-time, even to the turban, and draw over their persons a wadded quilt, to which is sewed the upper sheet, as a certain way of preventing it from shifting its position with reference to the quilt. Nothing else appears in the room, and ingress and egress is as free when ladies are in bed as at any other hour: hence the reason why the peasant spoken of at p. 62 of this volume so unceremoniously enters where Lady Hester is lying. In some houses, where the sofas are of sufficient breadth, even the mattress is dispensed with, and the quilt alone is all that is required for the night‚Äôs repose.</p>
<p>Lady Hester had adopted the same mode of sleeping. Her bed-room differed in nothing from the one described, excepting that, from an invincible repugnance to sleep on the floor, yet342 unable to procure a European bedstead, she had substituted in its place deal planks laid on trestles, which were stationary; and this was a constant source of difficulty and ridicule with the maids, whose prejudices against an immoveable bed never were entirely eradicated. On this she slept, attired as completely as when up, and the most scrupulous prudery could find no difference between her couch and her drawing-room sofa, unless it was that on one she lay, on the other she sat. Most often, however, when in conversation, she sat up in her bed, with a short pelisse over her shoulders, such as Polish ladies often wear. Her bath-room was her dressing-room.</p>
<p>In the early part of my life I was acquainted with the Prince C‚Äî‚Äî, Hospodar of Wallachia, who had fled from his principality to Geneva. I never shall forget the impression which an introduction to his daughter, a young princess, made on me, when (not for a medical visit, but for one of friendship) I was ushered into a bed-room and shook hands with her, seated in her bed, dressed in the way represented above as usual with the Turks. Guests went and came as if she had been in the drawing-room, and, no doubt, some two or three Europeans among the number were as much astonished as myself. But how frivolous and empty are the distinctions which men create between right and wrong, when weighed in the balance of reason! I have dined with a French countess (who had taken a temporary lodging in Paris) in her bed-room; yet she never dreamed of impropriety; but I have been told, had I inadvertently put my hat down on her bed instead of a chair, her femme-de-chambre and she herself would have been scandalized at the imputation such an act conveyed.</p>

<p>‚ÄúArgument with the Princess about her toilette; she piques herself on dressing quick; I disapprove this. She maintains her point; I, however, desire Madame Busche to explain to her that the Prince is very delicate, and that he expects a long and very careful ‚Äòtoilette de propret√©,‚Äô of which she has no idea. On the contrary, she neglects it sadly, and is offensive from this neglect.‚Äù</p>
<p>In this extract from Lord Malmesbury‚Äôs Diary, it will be seen how accurate his observations were, and how well they tally with Lady Hester Stanhope‚Äôs, who must have had opportunities of knowing all this even better than his Lordship could.</p>
<p>His Lordship in his diary again returns to the subject. ‚ÄúI endeavoured,‚Äù (says he) ‚Äúas far as was possible for a man, to344 inculcate the necessity of great and nice attention to every part of dress, as well as to what was hid as to what was seen. I knew she wore coarse petticoats, coarse shifts, and thread stockings, and these never well washed, or changed often enough&hellip;. It is remarkable how amazingly her education has been neglected, and how much her mother, although an English woman, was inattentive to it.‚Äù‚ÄîDiaries and Correspondence of the Earl of Malmesbury, v. iii. pp. 207, 211.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢
Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢‚Äôs goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ and future generations.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit <a class="link" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: <a class="link" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ electronic works
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: <a class="link" href="https://www.gutenberg.org"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >www.gutenberg.org</a>.
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
