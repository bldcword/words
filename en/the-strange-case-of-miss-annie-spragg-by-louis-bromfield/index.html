<p>THE THING FOUND IN THE CESSPOOL</p>
<p>tor the mountains or the sea. Left behind there
were only stray bands of sweating tourists and a
few such remnants of the permanent colony as Mrs.
Weatherby and the&rsquo; mysterious companion whom
no one had ever met; old Mrs. Whitehead, Mr
Binnop, the curate of the English church, the usual
Marchesas and Contessas, thick as flies, and Mr.
Augustus John Winnery. Except Mrs. Weatherby
all these stayed in baking Brinoe for the same rea-
son. (The old Contessa Salverini put up her
shutters and lived in the back of her house, giving
out word that she had gone to Montecatini for the
cure, and receiving aU her letters by arrangement
with the paste restante of Montecatini.) None of
them would have given you the real reason. They
jayed because they could not leave their beloved
Brinoe or because they were engaged in some work
of an archffiological or literary.nature which forced
them to remain. The real reason was that they
were all too poor to leave. t '</p>
<p>, In. the case of Mr. Winnery, he could not leave</p>
<p>was called ‚ÄúMiracles and Other Natural Phe-
nomena.‚Äù In speaking of this work he always
placed a profound emphasis on the word natural
lest you should think that he was taken in by such
nonsense as miracles. He was a small, bald man
of fifty-two and a quarter of a century earlier he
had written parodies and light verse which had ap-
peared now and then in the Yellow Book. But a
kind of blight had fallen early on his literary
career and for years now he had been devoting his
none too_ great energies to demolishing the idea of
miracles in general and the legends clustered about
the saints in particular.</p>
<p>His work kept him in Brinoe. It had kept him
there for twenty-nine previous and consecutive sum-
mers, and it was not yet completed. (Indeed, only
Mr. Winnery knew that it was still in a chaotic
stage, consisting almost entirely of huge accumula-
tions of notes and copyings from various little-
known books on the saints.) Still, it served its
purpose, and year after year it continued to give
him a faint echo of that fleeting glory which he had
^ young literary radical. Old Mrs.
Whitehead and those Anglo-Saxon Marchesas and
Contessas who had not become more Catholic than
the Blackest Black stffl spoke of Mr. Winnery‚Äôs
work with a land of awe. Mr. Binnop, the curate,
who pnded himself on being broadminded, did not
mention the work at aU, but he did not, on the other
hand, allow it to interfere with his friendship with</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 3</p>
<p>And now in the scalding heat of the August mid-
afternoon Ml. Vi&rsquo; innery was driving in a decrepit
fiacre up the long winding road that led to the
heights of Monte Salvatore. He cursed the heat
and himself and Mrs. Weatherby, Miss Annie
Spragg, the coachman and Brinoe itself ‚Äî sacred,
beautiful, romantic Brinoe, surrounded by blue hills
covered with clouds of blue violets and fragrant
narcissus. Of course, thought Mr. Winnery bit-
terly, the poetic temperament always chose to write
about Brinoe in May and never in August. Now if
a scientist, a realist, had written of Brinoe, it would
have been another story. He hated Brinoe^ not be-
cause It actually lacked all the miraculous qualities
attributed to it by Browning, Longfellow and the
advertisements of the tourist agencies, but because
he had to live there. Poverty and inertia had
chained him to Brinoe for twenty-nine years and
now at fifty-two he saw no prospect of escaping
from It even in death. In the end he would be laid
to rest, after a service read by Mr. Binnop (who
read the service so badly) in the Protestant ceme-
tery. It would have to be the Protestant cemetery
^cause there was no special cemetery for agnostics
He would rest m death among all the poets, spin-
sters, retired colonels, widows, decayed clergymen
and adulteresses who since the eighteenth century
had lived and died among the exaggerated beauties</p>
<p>nld^iu ^ he would be kid to rest beside
rif Whitehead Perhaps even in her grave</p>

<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>The fiacre moved in a cloud of yellow dust. Yel-
low dust covered the black C5rpresses and the grey
olive trees and the blue-black ilex that wilted against
walls turned a bilious yellow by the unrelenting sun.
‚ÄúAh,‚Äù thought Mr. Winnery bitterly, ‚Äúthe beautiful
blue cloudless sky of Italy. Italy, land of laughter
and sunshine. Ha ! Ha !‚Äù But it was worse than
that, for added to the baking sun there was a hot
wind from Africa. It had been blowing steadily
for two days, having sprung up on the night of Miss
Annie Spragg‚Äôs death. It bore on its restless bosom
clouds of dust and heat from the Sahara all the way
across the blue Mediterranean to the foothills of
the Alps. You wakened in the morning to see the
trees on the hills above Brinoe swaying in what
appeared to be a cool fresh breeze and then you
thrust your shutters open to find that it was a wind
charged with the heat of all Inferno. And quickly
you clapped the shutters tight again, feeling slightly
insane.</p>
<p>The driver of the fiacre smelled of sweat and
garlic and beat his bony horses from time to time
with the butt of his whip across their already scarred
and blistered rumps. ‚ÄúAh,‚Äù thought Mr. Winnery
bitterly, ‚Äúthese gay, kindly, carefree Italians. Chil-
dren of Nature.‚Äù (So read the tourist circulars.)
He fell to cursing Ruskin and Browning. ‚ÄúWhere
you rest, there decorate,‚Äù wrote Mr. Ruskin. (He
was not sure that he had the quotation correctly,
but that was the idea. ) The Italians never stopped
decorating. It was their passion for decoration
that had induced them to cover the seat of the fiacre
with great excrescences of soiled imitation filet lace.</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>The seat was at least black. You would not have
noticed the dirt. Or if they must decorate, why
did they not wash the decorations from time to
time?</p>
<p>Mr. Winnery was a bachelor and wore yellow&rsquo;
gloves to keep microbes from his plump pink hands.</p>
<p>Fifty-two years of bachelordom had induced a
certain inflexible routine into his manner of living.
For at least twenty years he had lived in the same
rooms, eaten the same food, risen and gone to bed
at the same hours, always found his cigarettes in
the same spot and his books where he had last put
them down. He had sent off his querulous book
reviews and his fashionable correspondence to the
Ladies‚Äô Own World at exactly the same day by ex-
actly the same post. On Thursdays he went to the
Principessa Bologna‚Äôs, on Mondays to Mrs. White-
head‚Äôs, and on Wednesdays to the Marchesa Bar-
ducci‚Äôs.</p>
<p>Today he had shattered the routine for the first
time in order to torture himself with the long drive
to Mrs. Weatherby‚Äôs villa. When he had gone
more than half-way he told himself that he had
simply gone insane with heat and boredom; but
having already suffered a really colossal discomfort
it did not seem worth while to turn back. In the
cool of the evening the journey would be an easier
one. At least it could not be more uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The only concrete i-eason he could discover for
the temporary outburst of insanity was a desire to
know something of Miss Annie Spragg, and Mrs.
Weatherby appeared to be the only person in all</p>

<p>f ‚ñ† &rsquo; &lsquo;6 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>I ! i Italy, or all the world, for that matter, who knew</p>
<p>i I i; anything of her. Mr. Winnery was out in the sun</p>
<p>M in the interests of science.</p>
<p>For twenty-nine years he had been writing his co-
lossal work and now for the first time a miracle had
occurred, as one might have said, just beneath his
nose. It was the miracle of the stigmata. In death an
eccentric old maid, who lived in one room of the
ruined old rookery known as the Palazzo Gon-
farini, had received the marks of the Crucifixion.
It was the miracle of Saint Francis of Assisi and
Saint Catherine of Siena. Three persons had
witnessed It, besides all the mob that broke in
afterward to carry off as relics all the furniture and
even the clothes of Miss Annie Spragg; these wit-
nesses were a nun known as Sister Annunziata, a
priest called Father Baldessare and the janitress of
the tenement, a bawdy, irreligious, anti-clerical So-
cialist shrew, who called herself Signora Bardelli.</p>
<p>Here, Mr. Winnery told himself, was a perfect
laboratory specimen of a miracle. He might investi-
gate and pull it apart to his heart‚Äôs content. It was
not, Mr. Winnery told himself, a very rare miracle.
It was always happening somewhere. There were
more than a hundred such cases on record. Only
last month there had been a sausage-maker‚Äôs daugh-
ter in Bavaria. . . . And there were only two cases
which had been recognized as authentic and one of
these at least ‚Äî ^that of Saint Catherine of Siena ‚Äî
he looked upon as dubious. No one but Saint Cath-</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 7</p>
<p>erine herself had witnessed the scars because she had
prayed that they be made invisible to others. And
then, as he pointed out in his work, she had also a
great motive in the rivalry between the Franciscans,
who claimed the miracle for the founder of their
order, and the Dominicans, of which she was in
reality, if not in name, the head. Pope Sixtus IV
had issued a decree at that time giving a monopoly
of the miracle to Saint Francis and making it a cen-
surable offense to mention Saint Catherine‚Äôs experi-
ence as authentic. Saint Catherine, Mr, Wiimery
thought, was a pov/erful but not a very original
woman.</p>
<p>But Miss Annie Spragg was neither Dominican
nor Franciscan. Indeed, no one seemed to know
whether she -was anything at all.</p>
<p>For at least fifteen years Miss Annie Spragg had
been one of the sights of Brinoe, like the Etruscan
excavations, and so Winnery had seen her countless
times. But it was not until she was dead that he,
in common with the rest of the world, learned her
name. Today it was a name printed in newspapers
all over the world. &hellip; In Paris, New York, Mi-
lan, Bombay, Copenhagen. . . . Tired journalists
had arrived in Brinoe from Rome and Paris and
Milan to report upon the mysterious happening.</p>
<p>For at least fifteen years Miss Annie Spragg had
wandered the streets regardless of heat or cold,
storm or sunshine ‚Äî an eccentric old maid whom the
Italians looked upon merely as one of the phe-
nomena of a generous Nature, and whom the for-
eign colony resented as something a little shameful.
She seemed never to have had but one costume.</p>

<p>8 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>This consisted of a bedraggled but miraculously
serviceable suit of tweed with a skirt which trailed
the ground alike in dust and mud, and a large
flowered picture hat on which the roses, from the
constant assault of the brilliant Italian sunlight, had
long since lost the glory of their original aniline
mauves and magentas. Over this hat she wore a
thick black veil and always on her hands she wore
white cotton gloves.</p>
<p>So little was known of her that in death there
seemed no one who was certain even of her national-
ity. One of the two Brinoe newspapers (bitter
rivals of each other) described her as ‚ÄúMiss Annie
Spragg, born at Newcastle-on-Tino (sic) , England,‚Äù
‚Äî a quite natural mistake due to the conviction of
all Italians that anyone eccentric must be English. It
was the mysterious Mrs. Weatherby who stepped
forward and corrected that impression. In bad
Italian she tactlessly addressed a letter to the rival
paper pointing out with some nationalistic feeling
that Miss Annie Spragg was certainly not English,
but American, and that she had once been a resident
of Winnebago Falls, Iowa, a city of which Mrs.
Weatherby was herself a native. Mrs. Weatherby
wrote that she had recognized the old maid soon
after coming to Brinoe when she encountered her
one day in the Piazza San Giovanni. The letter
was signed Henrietta Weatherby (Mrs. Alonzo
Weatherby), Villa Leonardo, Monte Salvatore.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weatherby was herself, Mr. Winnery be-
lieved, something of an eccentric. In winter and in the
spring she was to be seen driving about the town in
a fiacre, clad all in white, with a flowing white veil.</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>In season she frequently carried a bouquet of tube-
roses. She was a middle-aged woman of powerful
build and in the circles frequented by Mr. Winnery
it was said that she was a seeress and contemplated
founding a new and what she chose to call an ‚Äúeclec-
tic‚Äù religion. In May it was her habit to retire to
the Villa Leonardo in a lonely valley some miles
beyond Monte Salvatore for the sake, it was said,
‚Äúof meditation and soul growth.‚Äù Old Mrs. White-
head, who sought out eveiy newcomer at least once,
reported an encounter with Mrs. Weatherby which
left her confused and baffled, owing, she said, to the
spiritual cast which Mrs. Weatherby insisted upon
giving to their brief conversation.</p>
<p>She was always accompanied by a plump and
youngish woman dressed in black who appeared to
be a sort of companion-secretary. No one had ever
heard the name of this lady and she had had speech
with no one. It was rumored that she was a deaf-
mute.</p>
<p>Ill</p>
<p>As the fiacre reached the crest of Monte Salva-
tore Mr. Winnery‚Äôs nerves became worn to a fine
edge. He began even to think gloomily of suicide.
His whole life, he told himself, had been a failure.
He had attained the age of fifty-two without any-
thing having happened to him. He had known
neither love nor love‚Äôs twin sister passion, and of
late the thought of the experiences which he had
overlooked troubled him profoundly. It was be-
coming a kind of neurasthenia. On its philosophic
side he found the thought terrifying. It meant that</p>
<p>10 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>he had missed the most important of human experi-
ences. Perhaps, he told himself, that was what the
world found lacking in his work ; a touch of passion
might have made him popular if not distinguished.
On the physical side of the question it had occurred
to him lately that the attainment of such experience
had not yet become an impossibility.</p>
<p>He was, he supposed, at that period which people
called In capital letters the Dangerous Age in Men.
And lately he had noticed a certain physical change
in himself, as though some gland too long inactive
had begun at last to perform its functions. He who
had always been a thin, fragile little man began to
grow heavier and feel stronger. Even his liver
seemed to trouble him less. He had begun to ex-
perience the growth of a new force and vitality
which at times shook him like a fever. He sup-
posed It was that new force which had driven him
out today in the burning heat. On the intellectual
side he had begun to have a curiosity about life
which was altogether new and quite disturbing. It
made him feel uneasy and restless, but although he
slept less well, the lack of sleep did not appear in
his new-found vigor to trouble him. Until the age
of fifty-two he had been a literary and classical
writer who wrote of love only in its more refined
aspects.</p>
<p>The carriage reached the square of Monte Salva-
tore (that romantic Monte Salvatore of which he
had dreamed in his Victorian youth and which now
looked a bilious yellow and smelled badly). It
passed through the baking streets and began to slip
down the opposite side of the hill into another</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>pocket-like valley filled to the brim with dust and
heat. Why, Mr. Winnery asked himself, should
anyone exchange the heat of this valley for that of
the other in the belief that it was cooler here or that
the air was any better. No one but a fool like this
Mrs. Weatherby. &hellip;</p>
<p>As the fiacre descended into the second valley
Winnery was forced to admit to himself that it did
seem cooler here. The trees appeared thicker and
less jaded and the dust less overwhelming, though
that may have been only because the road was rarely
used. They ascended for a time and then began a
descent so sharp that the fiacre pressed close against
the buttocks of the bony horses, and presently on
turning a corner the driver turned and in a wave
of garlic exclaimed with an operatic gesture, ‚ÄúBe-
hold the Villa Leonardo.‚Äù</p>
<p>There was no villa to be seen, but only an island
of dark thick trees clinging to the side of the moun-
tain and leading up to it a long avenue of venerable
oaks. As they drew near, it became evident that
the narrow road ended at the villa itself and had
no other reason for existence. The clump of trees
was like a patch of black sewn upon the side of
the grey and yellow hill. There was no other
building of any sort near it. Indeed, thought Win-
nery, it must be impossible to see from there any
human habitation. (Fie was a gentleman given to
rather pompous language, who had known his great
flowering in the day of the mot juste.) It did seem
cooler here, though it may have been only the sense
of isolation that enveloped the ancient villa.</p>
<p>On either side of the long straight drive leading</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>i-</p>
<p>up to the house stood pillars of reddish stone, each
surmounted by a panther and a goat with a serpent
at their feet. The panther and the goat held be-
tween them a shield upon which no arms had ever
been cut. So damaged were the figures by time and
weather that a less antiquarian eye than Mr. Win-
nery‚Äôs would not have known them for what they
were. Straight ahead the avenue lost itself in the
shadows of gnarled and ancient trees which hung
closely over the road.</p>
<p>After they had gone a little way, the villa itself
came into view ‚Äî a commonplace yellowish villa set
among cypresses and olive trees with a flat facade
ornamented in the fashion of Spanish rather than
Italian baroque. It had an unkempt look with its
shutters all closed against the heat and the shrub-
bery aU straggly and unpruned. At the door, just
beside a large clump of sword-like yuccas, stood a
smart motor painted black with a delicate red stripe
running about the top. It was an eccentric, Latin
and expensive car, shining with too much polished
metal and too many elegant appurtenances, of the
kind known as une voiture de grand sport. The
sight of it tended to raise the spirits of Mr. Win-
nery. It meant that he would not be compelled to
encounter the formidable Mrs. Weatherby alone.</p>
<p>As he came nearer still, he saw that a part of the
villa on the side next to the valley had been built
upon a sort of terrace foundation of a much older
period. This, Mr. Winnery saw, was of Roman
construction. It might be that underneath it lay
an even more ancient foundation of Etruscan origin.</p>
<p>‚ÄúExtremely interesting,‚Äù he murmured, so loudly</p>
<p>&lsquo;‚ñ†m</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>that the driver turned as if in expectation of an or-
der and then saw at once that his fare was thinking
of other things.</p>
<p>The house was placed so that it commanded a
superb view of the lonely valley, a view indeed
which one would never have suspected from the ap-
proach. Perhaps, he thought, it had been chosen
in the beginning by some Roman for its sense of
space, a thing so rare in the crowded valleys about
Brinoe. At the very bottom of the valley there
was a yellow line tracing the course of a freshet,
now completely dry in the heat of mid-August, jlnd
suddenly he felt suffocated once more and choking
with dust.</p>
<p>The carriage stopped before the door and Mr.
Winne^, after putting on his yellow gloves and en-
deavoring vainly to brush the thick dust from his
clothing, went up the steps and pulled a copper bell-
handle made in the form of a ram‚Äôs head and
covered by a patine of verdigris. There was an
answering tinkle of a bell, but no other evidence of
life. He rang again and then again with no more
success, and suddenly he was aware that the driver
was looking at him with an expression of malice as
if he said, ‚ÄúYou forced me to come ail the way out
here in the heat for nothing.‚Äù It was a perfectly
blank expression, but touched with insinuation. It
made Mr. Winnery suddenly angry and embar-
rassed. It reminded him how he detested Italians
as a race. He pulled violently and the bell answered
again with a mocking violence. Then he turned and
saying, ‚Äò Wait for me here,‚Äù came down the steps</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>r</p>
<p>and took a grass-grown path that led through a
tangle of ivy and cypress hedge toward the back
of the house.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>For more than a hundi-ed feet Winnery made his
way through a sort of tunnel of foliage, so thick
that even at this season the earth beneath his feet
seemed damp and moist, and then all at once he
came upon the most extraordinary and beautiful
garden. It was large and square in size and so
placed upon the artificially raised terrace that it
seemed to hang in space above the valley. The gar-
den was entirely of greenery, a sort of vast chamber
of which roof and walls were made of foliage.
There was no flower of any sort. The villa itself
made one wall and the other three sides were en-
tirely closed by the thick walls of ancient cypresses
of a size Winnery had never seen save at Tivoli.
Near the ground where the cypresses had no foliage,
light, reflected from the grey and yellow valley be-
low, filtered in between the ancient grey trunks.
Over the whole garden there was a living roof made
by the branches of countless plane trees planted to
form colonnades and so trimmed and trained that
their yellowing leaves shut out all heat and light.
Within this area the sun never penetrated and there
was no grass but only a carpet of red clay flecked
here and there by patches of moss which in the ex-
traordinary light had turned an unreal and poison-
ous shade of green. It was as if in the entire
parched and desolate valley, life, green and exuber-
ant, flourished only within this enclosure.</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 15</p>
<p>At first he had thought the garden empty, too,
and silent like the house, but after a moment, when
his eyes had grown accustomed to the fierce blaze of
hot light from the valley below, he discovered a
group of figures at the far end. There appeared
to be several servants and working men, and four
women, of whom one, a vision of fluttering white,
was unmistakably the seeress, Mrs. Weatherby.
There was also a tall gentleman dressed all in black,
with silver hair. They stood gathered about a hole
which appeared to be the termination of a long
trench freshly cut from the direction of the villa
itself. The damp red clay lay heaped about their
feet. And then as he approached he discovered the
object of their scrutiny ‚Äî something which appeared
to be the size and shape of a man and which was
flecked and discolored by the clay.</p>
<p>^ ‚ÄúAh,‚Äù thought Mr. Winnery. ‚ÄúThey have been
digging a cesspool.‚Äù</p>
<p>first noticed him and spoke to Mrs. Weatherby.
The seeress turned and came toward him. She did
not walk^ she floated in an artificial and gracious
manner which made him know at once that she had
practiced this walk for many years. She was a
heavy woman not without a certain handsomeness
due to her size and her majestic carriage. As she
drew near she held out her hand and, exposing an
array of flashing, healthy teeth in a practiced smile,
said, ‚ÄúMr. Winnery, I presume.‚Äù</p>
<p>And Winnery, fixing his face determinedly into a
smile, murmured, ‚ÄúIt was good of you to let me
come, Mrs. Weatherby.‚Äù</p>
<p>i6 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>Together they turned toward the others.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am afraid there was no one to answer the belL
We had all come out here, even the servants. We
have just made a remarkable discovery. While dig-
ging a new cesspool, the workmen unearthed a
statae. We have been unable to identify it. It
seems to me a very strange statue.‚Äù</p>
<p>In the back of his mind Winnery kept thinking,
‚ÄúI loathe this woman because she is refined and be-
cause she is so healthy and therefore so entirely out
of place here.‚Äù Because he had a liver, healthy
people full of vitality had long been abhorrent to
him, like people who whistle and sing in their morn-
ing tubs.</p>
<p>He was then introduced, first to a tall, handsome
but rather battered woman of fifty, dressed smartly
and much too youthfully in clothes which by their
simplicity and cut bore the mark of the most expen-
sive of Paris dressmakers. The woman had for
him a faint air of familiarity. It was a face he had
seen somewhere, the face of a woman of fifty which
has been much worked over. She wore a great
many bracelets and a string of real pearls.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPrincipessa d‚ÄôOrobelli,‚Äù murmured Mrs. Weath-
erby, with a quiver of satisfaction. And then
Mr. Winnery knew. She was one of those brilliant
birds of passage whose photographs taken at the
Lido surrounded by naked young men, whose names
were of no importance, appeared from time to time
in the illustrated weeklies. Although he had never
seen her before, he had written many paragraphs for
the Ladies‚Äô Own World concerning her movements</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 17</p>
<p>hither and yon across the face of Italy. She was the
smart, the almost notorious, d‚ÄôOrobelli.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd Father d‚ÄôAstier,‚Äù murmured Mrs.
Weatherby with a pleased and gracious nod in the
direction of the silver-haired gentleman. Father
d‚ÄôAstier bowed, a tall, handsome man with intense
black eyes, a fine nose and a splendid rather sensual
mouth, a figure at sixty possessed of great vigor and
distinction. Winnery knew of him, too, a priest
without any parish save all of God‚Äôs world, who
lunched and dined ‚Äúeverywhere.‚Äù He had a simple
mission in life : it was to convert the rich who mar-
ried impoverished titles and to help on their way to
grace any others of considerable wealth who felt a
leaning toward Rome. He was a confessor to many
fashionable and scandalous ladies, to great bankers
and members of decayed royal families. Old
stories of Father d‚ÄôAstier and ‚Äúthe d‚ÄôOrobelli‚Äù
(as Winnery thought of her), heard at second-
hand through years, rolled through the back of his
mind. F or an instant it gave him a pleasant, warm
sense of moving in the great world.</p>
<dl>
<dt>And Miss Fosdick,‚Äù concluded ISdrs. ^V^eatherby</dt>
<dt>with a slight and careless gesture as if she were</dt>
<dt>tossing a piece of dirt over her shoulder. The ges-</dt>
<dt>ture indicated the plump, shy little woman dressed</dt>
<dt>in black who stood in the background with a touch-</dt>
<dt>ing air of timidity. This, of course, was Mrs.</dt>
<dt>Weatherby‚Äôs companion, the deaf-mute. Out of</dt>
<dt>the corner of his eye, Winnery saw how she hovered</dt>
<dt>m the background, almost tremidpui^-dhscured by</dt>
<dt>that figure all in white wiiich&rsquo;&rsquo;s^¬Æd-a!^ &lt;fece&rsquo;&rsquo;‚Äô&rsquo;s&amp;</dt>

<p>i8 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>shadow. She was shy too and frightened like a bird.
Mr. Winnery felt a sudden wave of pity for her.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat an awful life !‚Äù he thought.</p>
<p>While they had been talking a workman appeared
coming down one of the long light-flecked corridors
of the garden, carrying in each hand a pail of water.
In his wide belt of black elastic was thrust a scrub-
bing-brush. He was a young man, dark and black-
eyed, who wore blue trousei&rsquo;s stained with the red
clay and a checkered shirt open to expose his dark
sunburned chest. Winnery, who through years of
boredom had come to amuse himself at desperate
moments by watching the sly, half-concealed actions
of people, saw Princess d‚ÄôOrobelli‚Äôs eye rove over
the masculine young figure. Herodias, he thought.
The workman knelt down and with the scrubbing-
brush began to remove the patches of red clay from
the freshly disinterred statue.</p>
<p>They stood about watching while the statue,
slightly pitted here and there by the action of
acids hidden in the sour ground of the dark gar-
den, emerged in all the beauty of its time-worn
creamy white marble. Princess d‚ÄôOrobelii whis-
pered something to Father d‚ÄôAstier. One of the
maidservants giggled and was silenced at once by a
glance of venom from Mrs. Weatherby, who had
clearly determined to regard this as a sacred mo-
ment.</p>
<p>Priapus himself had risen from the mouldering
soil of the ancient garden.</p>
<p>Whatever hand carved the figure had moved with
understanding and passion. The statue carried in
every line a kind of quivering voluptuousness. The</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>very curves of the muscles and the line of the back
and hips quivered between the realms of ecstasy and
that disgust which follows quickly upon satiety. It
was a glorification of sensuality. Indeed, the
sculptor had done his work so well that for a long
time the little group about the excavation stood
awed into silence, as if something had risen from
the red clay which roused disturbing memories in
those who were experienced and disturbing intima-
tions in those who had remained until that moment
virginal. No one could have remained entirely
chaste after looking upon the statue.</p>
<p>There were certain portions of the statue missing,
and Mrs. Weatherby, noting this, said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll set
Giovanni to work tomorrow digging for the rest.‚Äù</p>
<p>But Father d‚ÄôAstier protested quickly, perhaps in
the interests of the church or perhaps because he
thought such a piece of marble better buried forever.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs no use, Mrs. Weatherby. You
might dig up the whole garden without discovering
anything. That is usually the case.‚Äù</p>
<p>Giovanni suddenly turned the statue full upon its
back so that the face, amazingly preserved, looked
up at them. It was the face of an old man, but a full
vigorous face partly covered by a magnificent curl-
ing beard drawn back to expose the lips,*rin which
there w‚Äô-as that same sensual beauty hovering betw‚Äôeen
ecstasy and disgust. WInnery, looking down at it,
thought, ‚ÄúIt is a beautiful thing, but a dangerous
and disturbing one. Ha-sfing it about, no one would
ever have peace. Perhaps it is safe with Mrs.
Weatherby. She is possibly insensitive to every-
thing.‚Äù And then he saw suddenly that Miss Fos-</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>dick was watching him and that she was blushing.
There was an odd flicker of sympathy between
them. Neither was very young and both were
without experience. Suddenly he thought her
appealing and young (though she must have been
at least thirty-five) beside the hardness of the no-
torious d‚ÄôOrobelli, the cold worldliness of Father
d‚ÄôAstier and the florid pretense of Mrs. Weatherby.</p>
<p>They set the statue against the wall of the gar-
den above a soft mattress of green ilex and then,
with Mrs. Weatherby floating befoi&rsquo;e them in a
cloud of white, they turned back toward the villa.
Winnery found himself walking beside Miss Fos-
dick, for he already detested his hostess and was
shy and frightened in the presence of such creatures
as the d‚ÄôOrobelli and Father d‚ÄôAstier. A sense of
depression still haunted them all. Once Winnery,
feeling embarrassed by this unnatural silence, mur-
mured to Miss Fosdick, ‚ÄúIt is a beautiful thing ‚Äî
that statue.‚Äù</p>
<p>To which the answer came quickly with blushes
and an unexpected passion. ‚ÄúNo, I think it‚Äôs horri-
ble.‚Äù</p>
<p>He knew then that the story of her being a deaf-
mute was not true.</p>
<p>They had tea in a great room painted a faded
pink and decorated with a series of frescoes depict-
ing the amorous excursions of Jupiter to the earth.
These frescoes might well have been called The
Apotheosis of Anatomy, for they were done by</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>some painter v/ith an admiration for Luca Sig-
norelli and every muscle was thrown into high re-
lief. The whole effect was one of a plump and
writhing unrest. But the proportions of the room
were noble and threw the frescoes into obscurity.
Unfortunately, Mrs. Weatherby had added fresh
horrors. The furniture was an odd mixture of
periods and styles, all of them the frankest imita-
tions. On the chairs she had placed indiscriminately
pillows of satin in the most bidlliant shades of
Veronese green, Tyrian purple and mustard yellow,
all trimmed with black and gold lace ‚Äî pillow&rsquo;s such
as are born only of the Latin imagination. She ex-
plained that it was always the general effect at which
she drove rather than the detail, and that therefore
the authenticity of furniture was of very little im-
portance to her. ‚ÄúThe effect,‚Äù she murmured, ‚Äúon
entering a room . . . the effect.‚Äù She allowed the
sentence to finish itself in a vague, fluttering gesture,
also (thought Mr. Winnery) the result of much
practice. A grey parrot squawked on a perch in
one corner and two tiny Pomeranians ran out
screeching and yapping as the party entered.</p>
<p>But when the shutters were thrown open the room
became magnificent, for one discovered that the
whole valley lay spread out beneath the windows.
The same golden light that filtered through into the
deep garden poured in through the great arched
openings that made one side of the room. The sun
had begun to slip down below the crests of the
mountain at the head of the valley and all the
African dust suspended in the hot air had caught
and reflected its rays in a blaze of extravagant color.</p>

<p>In the bottom of the valley the lights were blue and
purple and at the top these turned to green and
yellow and a curious shade of red gold. It was
exaggerated and, to Mr. Winnery‚Äôs English eyes, a
little overdone, like everything in Italy.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat a marvelous place,‚Äù murmured the Prin-
cess in a deep, throaty voice. ‚ÄúWhy have I never
seen it or heard of it?‚Äù</p>
<p>At that moment a servant brought tea, bad tea,
of the kind bought in Italy in ancient tins, and bis-
cuits, also out of tins, that were dry and hard.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI have never placed much importance ripon
food,‚Äù observed Mrs. Weatherby as she seated her-
self in an imitation Renaissance chair inlaid with
mother-of-pearl. ‚ÄúI have lived for seventeen
years on the spirit, ever since I lost Mr. Weatherby
and discovered the consolations of religion.‚Äù She
turned suddenly and addressed her companion.
‚ÄúWill you pour, Gertrude ?‚Äù And again to the Prin-
cess d‚ÄôOrobelli, ‚ÄòWes, it is a place rich in tradition
and history, rich indeed.‚Äù Again her words trailed
off into space as if she found them poor, shabby
things to express all the beauty of which she alone
was conscious.</p>
<p>Winnery began to suspect that this transparent
woman fancied herself as an enigma, a kind of
Sibyl. Watching her, he began to suspect, too, that
she was a very rich and a very mean woman, and
that she sought to gloss over her meannesses by any
motive at hand. She would have dragged in God
Himsdf if necessary. He saw also that Father
d‚ÄôAstier and the Princess were profoundly bored
and that upon both their faces had appeared that</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>mechanical smile which is a strange mixture of con-
descension, absent-mindedness and a desire to be
polite ‚Äî -a smile which is one of the marks of persons
frequenting smart society. Thirty years of this
practice had fixed hard lines on the face of the Prin-
cess. He asked himself suddenly why that strange
pair had stayed to tea when they might easily have
sped back to Brinoe in the black and red motor.
Indeed, he could not see why they were there at all.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weatherby, who had now struck an attitude
in the awkward Renaissance chair, continued her
discussion of the history of the place. It went back,
she said, to Roman times at least. The very statue
they had just discovered proved as much. Then
certainly it had once been occupied by Leonardo da
Vinci, who, it was said, had used the cow&rsquo;shed for
his famous experiments in flying, and after that it
had been the property of the Spanish Ambassador
at Brinoe, who used it as a summer residence and
added the baroque fagade with its agitated statues.
Mrs. Weatherby ornamented the account w&rsquo;ith many
minute and boring details, most of them completely
inaccurate, since Mi&rsquo;s. Weatherby possessed but the
sketchiest ideas of Italian history. Each inaccuracy
caused Winnery to wince and struggle with a desire
to set her right, for he was one who cared pro-
foundly for detail. He would have spoken, but that
instinct told him his effort was certain to make no
impression and would only delay the story of Miss
Annie Spragg. A woman accustomed to making
over religions would not be awed by history. Be-
sides, as in the case of the furniture, it was the effect
she sought rather than the accuracy of detail.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>During all this time Miss Fosdick sat quietly, her
little pink hands resting in her lap, but it was clear
that her thoughts had wandered far from the im-
pressive account which she must already have heard
a thousand times. She kept looking out into the
magnificent valley, that valley which as night came
nearer and nearer, began to approach in a miracu-
lous fashion that ideal which Winnery had once had
of the beauties of Italy. Here through these win-
dows one beheld no beggars and no Fascist!, one
was aware of no smells and no dirt, but only the
magnificence of Nature itself undefiled by the touch
of man. Winnery for a moment felt that its beauty
compensated a little for the boredom of being com-
pelled to live in Brinoe.</p>
<p>But presently he found himself more fascinated
by Miss Fosdick than by the beauty of the view.
He no longer heard Mrs. Weatherby. Her sonor-
ous voice had become simply a dim annoyance, like
the buzzing of a fly. Her rapturous bosom no
longer heaved and fell within the line of his vision.
He was touched by the look of hunger in the eyes
of her poor companion. It was a look which showed
itself in the eyes alone, for the rest of the face wore
a fixed and practiced expression of sweetness and
contentment as befitted the handmaiden of a great
religious teacher. She even managed to look as if
she were interested. Once more she seemed to him
touchingly young and innocent, like a bird . . . (he
groped for a moment for the proper literary image)</p>
<p>. . . like a bird that is being tormented. She was
aware, he thought, of a beauty which lay beyond the
valley, a beauty, too, which had nothing to do with</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>the calcomine of the religions through which Mrs.
Weatherby must have dragged her by the hair of
her head. And then suddenly he experienced ex-
citement at the sight of her soft full throat and the
rather matronly curve of the bosom beneath the
shining black poplin. He began to see her for the
first time ‚Äî her ¬£ne hair and melancholy eyes, her
high color and all her Rubens curves. The experi-
ence startled him for a second, as something new
in all his experience. He could trace it vaguely
only to the strange obscene influence of the statue.
But it pleased and flattered him that the emotion
should have occurred at all.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weatherby had by now become launched
upon her period of religious experiment among the
numerous sects of Southern California, but the
Princess d‚ÄôOrobelli arose and, taking the matter
firmly in hand, cut her short and at the same time
revealed the reason for her coming to the Villa
Leonardo. She said, ‚ÄúDo tell us, Mrs. Weatherby,
what you know of this Spragg woman? I am dining
with friends and must leave soon. I should like to
know the story. It will help make the dinner a suc-
cess. No one is talking of anything else but Miss
Annie Spragg.‚Äù</p>
<p>So that was the reason why the Princess and
Father d‚ÄôAstier had made the hot, dusty journey!
They had come to the apparent fount of all knowl-
edge upon the subject of Miss Annie Spragg.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weatherby, upset for a moment at being
interrupted in the process of making herself enig-
matic, recovered quickly and said, ‚ÄúOf course, I
never really knew her any more than I knew her</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>here in Brinoe. We lived in the same community
but, as you might say, in different worlds. Gertrude
knew her better than I. Isn‚Äôt that true, Gertrude?‚Äù
She turned to wrest the attention of her companion
away from the unsafe extravagant beauty of the
valley and back into the room. From the irritation
in her voice it was clear that she had known all
along, despite even Miss Fosdick‚Äôs perfected expres-
sion of deep interest, that her companion‚Äôs thoughts
were wandering. It was clear also, thought Win-
nery, that later, when the guests were gone, Miss
Fosdick would pay for her inattention. She would
pay dearly.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYes, Aunt Henrietta?‚Äù replied Miss Fosdick
mildly.</p>
<p>Aunt Henrietta, thought Winnery. Then she
must be the niece of Mrs. Vv&quot; eatherby.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Weatherby displayed no intention of
allowing Miss Fosdick, however well she knew the
story, to tell it. She rolled into it in sonorous but
refined periods, embroidered by a great deal of ex-
planation as to setting and background.</p>
<p>VI</p>
<p>Fifteen years earlier Mrs. Weatherby had been
the richest and the most important woman in
Winnebago Falls, since her husband, the late Mr.
Alonzo Weatherby, had been president of the
Farmers‚Äô Bank and also held a monopoly on the
new water works. Since then, Mrs. Weatherby in-
dicated modestly, she had become vastly, incalculably
richer due to the fact that Mr. Weatherby before</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>dying had invested money in certain tracts of waste
land in Oklahoma which now poured forth gold in
the form of oil. He had been, one gathered from
her accounts, a shrewd but ineffectual little man
whom she had browbeaten into the status of a con-
sort. Winnery saw him perfectly ‚Äî the husband of
Mrs. Weatherby, Mr. Henrietta Weatherby. He
had observed a great many Mr. and Mrs.
Weatherb}&rsquo;‚Äôs among the American tourists who
visited Brinoe. She spoke of him v/ith condescen-
sion and even with a little contempt, as vaguely use-
less and perfectly insignificant.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think I can say honestly,‚Äù she added, ‚Äúthat he
was always spiritually my inferior.‚Äù</p>
<p>The town of Winnebago Falls, which she also de-
scribed with a great amount of detail, rose up in a
kind of crude reality as a town old as towns went
in Iowa, of big houses built in the floidd style of the
eighties and set back from streets lined with rows
of cottonwoods and elms ‚Äî a town which was the
center of an agricultural community and so rather
sleepy and quiet and the last place in which to ex-
pect such stories as she had to tell of Miss Annie
Spragg.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWinnebago Falls,‚Äù she said proudly, ‚Äúwas not
one of those German settlements in Iowa. It was
founded by New Englanders. One of them was my
grandfather.‚Äù</p>
<p>She made it clear that she was important, not
alone by wealth, but also by blood, and even more
than that by the faith into which she had been born.
‚ÄúMiss Fosdick and myself were both Congrega-
tionalists, and in such a place the best people were</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>always Congregationalists. That Is one of the
reasons why I never really knew Miss Annie
Spragg. She was a Primitive Methodist and kept
house for her brother, who was much older than
herself and a Primitive Methodist preacher. But
the Primitive Methodists were an insignificant lot
and mostly poor whites from the Kentucky moun-
tains.‚Äù</p>
<p>At this point Father d‚ÄôAstier, speaking English
with all the elegance of one who knows a foreign
tongue perfectly, interrupted to ask exactly what
was a poor w-hite. He listened with great interest
while she explained and when It was made clear she
said, ‚ÄúOf course. Miss Fosdick knew Miss Spragg
better than myself. There were reasons for that.‚Äù</p>
<p>She made clear the reasons. Miss Fosdick‚Äôs
mother had been a girl friend of Mrs. Weatherby.
They had gone to school together and been married
on the same day, but from that moment their courses
had diverged, for Mrs. Weatherby‚Äôs husband had
gone up in the world and Mrs. Fosdick‚Äôs had slipped
steadily down into poverty. With poverty social ob-
scurity came to her old school friend and Mrs. Fos-
dick‚Äôs daughter, who now sat plump and on the verge
of middle age in the Villa Leonardo, had been forced
to do the best she could. Thus she had come into
contact with individuals In Winnebago Fails whom
Mrs. Weatherby knew only distantly if at all.
Among these individuals was Miss Spragg.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut I never forgot that Emma Fosdick had al-
ways been my friend,‚Äù continued Mrs. Weatherby,
‚Äúand I did all I could for her daughter Gertrude.‚Äù</p>
<p>She indicated her companion with the gesture of</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>one showing his good works to the Lord. The
wretched ;Miss Fosdick turned quickly and gave an
appreciative smile in the direction of her benefactor
and then fell once more to staring out of the window
into the purpling valley, looking confused and tor-
tured and miserable.</p>
<p>; &rsquo; To Winnery, watching her, the thought occurred
again that she was like a plump pigeon used by the
preposterous woman in white as an object upon
which to practice some obscure and sadistic tor-
ment.</p>
<p>Mrs, Weatherby shifted her position a little,
causing the imitation chair to creak beneath her
weight. At the same moment the parrot burst with
a terrifying suddenness into a series of shrill screams
and squawks.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe wants to go to bed,‚Äù said Mrs. Weatherby,
turning to Miss Fosdick. ‚ÄúWill you take him away,
dear! He should have gone long ago.‚Äù</p>
<p>Miss Fosdick rose with an awkward self-conscious
gesture of brushing imaginary crumbs from her lap,
and murmuring, ‚ÄúYes, Aunt Flenrietta,‚Äù took the
unpleasant bird from its perch and carried it, still
screeching horribly, off into the shadows of the great
echoing hall where the darkness appeared to quiet
its nerves.</p>
<p>As she went out the door, Mrs. Weatherby mur-
mured, ‚ÄúShe is a good girl and a great comfort to
me. She has lived with me now ever since she was
eighteen, when Mr, Weatherby died and I went to
California. She has never cared to marry. Indeed,
I think she has never found a man worthy of her.‚Äù
With the disappearance of Miss Fosdick, Mr.</p>
<p>3 ¬∞</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>Winnery felt a little pang of disappointment like
the first faint warnings of an approaching indiges-
tion. She seemed to him the only healthy, simple
creature in the room.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut to get on with Miss Spragg,‚Äù said Mrs.
Weatherby. ‚ÄúShe always lived a very quiet life
and seldom went out except in the evenings. She
was always a little queer, but she grew queerer and
queerer as she grew middle-aged.‚Äù</p>
<p>Miss Spragg had occupied, it seemed, with her
brother the clergyman, a small wmoden house of
some six rooms set back from the street in a tangle
of lilacs, maple trees and vines in the poorest part
of town. Soon after she came there, either she or
her brother had a high wooden fence built to enclose
the back yard. What went on inside the fence no
one knew very clearly, but it became knowm grad-
ually that it concealed a weird collection of animals.
The old maid, people said, was very fond of them.
There were guinea-pigs, rabbits, cats, a pair of de-
crepit dogs, and at one period, Mrs. Weatherby
heard, even a skunk. The thick trees about the
house were alive with birds and they came from all
over the town to be fed within the enclosure.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat,‚Äù interrupted Father d‚ÄôAstier, ‚Äúwould per-
haps explain her having chosen Saint Francis of
Assisi for special adoration in her old age.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt was Saint John the Shepherd,‚Äù put in Mr.
Winnery; and then with a burst of Non-Conformist
emotion, ‚Äúwho in the Roman church is merely a sur-
vival of the pagan Dionysus.‚Äù</p>
<p>Mrs. Weatherby ignored the comment, perhaps
because she had no idea of Saint Francis, of Saint</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>John the Shepherd, or Dionysus, and sweeping on,
said, ‚ÄúI used to see her sometimes, but I ne%^er cared
for her. She had a proud way of walking, like a
cat, and she gave herself airs, as if she was better
than other people. In the end that was what made
other people hate her. The congregation of her
brother‚Äôs church took a great dislike to her because
she would never join in church work and never went
to call on any of them. I don‚Äôt suppose there \vas
anybody in the town who in all the years she lived
in Winnebago Fails had a dozen words with her.
Nobody ever knew anything about her. They just
took her for granted after a time. It was the black
goat that first began to make trouble.‚Äù</p>
<p>From somewhere, perhaps from some Irish fam-
ily living near the railroad in \¬•innebago Falls, the
old maid acquired a black he-goat to add to her pets.
There was no reason, said Mrs. ^Veatherby, why a
goat should seem a pet more strange than a dog
except that the human race has always had a curious
feeling about goats, and in Winnebago Fails this
feeling turned to comment and indignation at the
sight of an old maid walking through the streets
with a goat by her side. For she developed the
habit of taking the goat at dusk each evening to the
outskirts of the town to feed on the thick sweet
clover that grew by the county road.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt was a queer thing to do,‚Äù observed Mrs.
Weatherby. ‚ÄúAnd in small towns, of course, every-
thing gets to be known and people aren‚Äôt as tolerant
as, well &hellip; we are in a place like Brinoe.‚Äù</p>
<p>This remark she accompanied by a sweeping ges-
ture in the direction of the distant city, as if she</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>would gather it up and enclose it within her over-
plump arms. It was her city, Brinoe ‚Äî Winnery
suddenly had the feeling that she v/ould make her
own anything which she thought might be of use to
her. She spoke as if her grandfather, instead of
being a Congregationalist, had been at least a Gon-
zaga or a Sforza.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut the worst trouble,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúcame about
when a man called Hasselman, who delivered milk
in Winnebago Fails, told the story that he saw her
coming home one morning just after daylight across
the fields fi&rsquo;om a place called Meeker‚Äôs Gulch.‚Äù
She paused for a moment and then added, ‚ÄúAnd the
goat was with her.‚Äù</p>
<p>The last sentence she uttered slowly and witli a
great ponderousness and then waited a moment.
The Princess, whose thoughts had clearly been wan-
dering, was sitting upright now. She had stopped
glancing at her watch and was listening, and into
the eyes of Father d‚ÄôAstier there had come a queer
look of pain.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNobody ever proved the stor}^,‚Äù said Mrs.
Weatherby, ‚Äúand Hasselman was known to drink,
so a great many people thought he had been seeing
things. But the people in the town began to get
uneasy about Miss Annie Spragg and say that she
ought to be shut up. A committee from the church
was going to see her brother about having her sent
away the very day he was murdered.‚Äù</p>
<p>Somewhere in one of the other rooms the parrot
began again to screech and Mrs. Weatherby, an-
noyed, suddenly rose and, floating across the room,
called out, ‚ÄúGertrude, Gertrude, %vhat are you do-</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>ing to Anubis?‚Äù There was an echo of cold
savagery in her voice, as if the parrot were the only
thing in the world she loved besides herself.</p>
<p>Miss Fosdick appeared again and in a tremulous
voice murmured, ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt seem to like being
shut up now. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs screeching.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWell, take the curtain off his cage and then fetch
a light.‚Äù</p>
<p>It had grown quite dark and the only light in the
room was the faint reflected glow of the dying sun-
set. Mrs. Weatherby seemed a little, thought Mr.
Winnery, like a figure out of a nightmare which
might suddenly turn out to be real. It was not true,
he told himself. There wasn‚Äôt any such person as
Mrs. Weatherby.</p>
<p>The Princess was murmuring, ‚ÄúBut the murder,
my dear Mrs. Weatherby. . . . You left us in mid-
air.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt has never been explained,‚Äù said Mrs.
Weatherby. ‚ÄúHe was found beaten to death in
broad daylight by the side of the road on the edge
of the town. It seems he used to compose his ser-
mons while taking long walks and it happened to
him then. They never found out who did it. People
said that she must have had something to do with
it and that she ought to have been shut up long be-
fore. I think they arrested her, but they couldn‚Äôt
prove that she was even out of the house that day.
I never knew much about it. It happened a little
while after I moved to California to begin my ex-
perimental work.‚Äù</p>
<p>And then suddenly, as if the story had come to
an end before she meant it to, she said weakly,</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs all there Is. After the murder she left
the town and nobody knew where she went until I
saw her in the Piazza San Giovanni two }&rsquo;ears ago.
I couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes at first, and then I seized
Miss Fosdick and said, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs that Spragg %voman.
Isn‚Äôt it, Gertrude?‚Äô and Miss Fosdick looked too,
and said, ‚ÄòYes!‚Äô We didn‚Äôt speak to her, because
she seemed so queer and we didn‚Äôt want to attract
attention.‚Äù She turned suddenly to Father d‚ÄôAsticr.
‚ÄúI suppose that was not humble of me or Christian
or Catholic, but I hadn‚Äôt then received the light.‚Äù</p>
<p>There was something about this remark and its
entire unexpectedness which made Winnery start
and ask himself, ‚ÄúWhat is she up to now? What
game is she playing with Father d‚ÄôAstier?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI remember it was two years ago because it was
at the Easter procession and it rained on Easter and
she was kneeling in the rain and vras wearing a big
picture hat covered with faded flowers. And the
colors were running in the rain.‚Äù</p>
<p>VII</p>
<p>At that moment Miss Fosdick appeai*ed, carrying
a huge wrought-iron candlestick almost as tall and
almost as heavy as herself. In it, burning, there was
one of those fat round candles which are to be seen
everywhere in the churches in Italy. In place of a
flame there was an electric bulb. She came in qui-
etly, put down the candlestick and retired silently
into the shadows.</p>
<p>The d‚ÄôOrobelli rose abruptly and said, ‚ÄúWhat a
very interesting story! But I am late. I must go.‚Äù</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>She made it clear none the less by some skilful in-
tonation of her voice or expression in her eyes that
she had really found it a boring tale badly told and
not worth the trip to the Villa Leonardo.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weatherby became a miracle of gracious-
ness and, bidding them all good-by, murmured, ‚ÄúI
must have a word with Father d‚ÄôAstier.‚Äù</p>
<p>Winnery would have gone into the hall with the
Princess, but he remembered that Miss Fosdick, for-
gotten and ungraceful, was lingering in the shadows.
He turned to speak to her and found that she was
coming toward him in order to light them out. At
the same moment he heard Mrs. Weatherby mur-
muring something to the priest. He was able to
catch only two words ‚Äî ‚Äúprayer and meditation‚Äù ‚Äî
and began to think that he had gone mad.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou will have to go out by the garden,‚Äù Mrs.
Weatherby was saying. ‚ÄúMargharita has stupidly
lost the key to the main door and no locksmith will
come from Brinoe until the end of the week.‚Äù</p>
<p>They moved down the hallway between dark
rooms, from one of which came the muffled indig-
nant squawking of the parrot Anubis, King of Dark-
ness. Winnery had taken the candlestick from the
frightened Miss Fosdick and was heading the little
procession. In the garden the light still filtered in
between the black trunks of the gigantic cypresses,
but it was a different light now, feeble and blue and
diffused, the light from a hot waning moon that had
risen above the mountains on the opposite side of
the valley. Far away, at the end of one of the tun-
nels made by the plantain trees, the statue, scrubbed
white now by the strong brown hands of Giovanni,</p>
<p>36 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>gleamed against the black ilex hedge. Mr. Win-
nery saw it again suddenly in his imagination. He
saw with a remarkable clearness all its beauty and
sensuality. It occurred to him that at some time in
the i-emote past there must have been other people
living here in this same ancient spot, living here and
perhaps worshipping the ancient figure of Priapus
‚Äî -troops of harlots and courtesans and voluptuaries.
And their successors had been Mrs. Weatherby and
Miss Fosdick, bringing with them so much that vras
the essence of a country that lay beyond Atlantis,
unknown and unimagined in the days when this Pria-
pus was carved.</p>
<p>In order to reach the front of the villa it was
necessary to pass again through the tangled green
tunnel which was too low to allow the passage of
the great candlestick. Miss Fosdick solved the
problem by removing the candle itself and leading
the v,ray. In order not to fall in tlie darkness they
took hands in chain fashion, first Miss Fosdick and
then Winnery, then the Princess and last of all
Father d‚ÄôAstier. Miss Fosdick‚Äôs hand was plump
and soft and placid, but the hand of the Princess
was thin and hard and feverish. Winnery thought
it was trembling violently.</p>
<p>And then as they approached the other side there
arose in the thick bushes very near at hand the faint
sound of a sculBe and a torrent of words uttered in
a soft masculine Italian and then the laugh, hot and
voluptuous and almost hysterical, of a woman. For
a second Mr. Winnery had the wild thought that he
had overheard the ghosts of that ancient garden,
and then the Princess, emerging from the hedge,</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>called out sharply, ‚ÄúEnrico! Enrico!‚Äù There [
a silence and she repeated the call and out of
bushes came a chauffeur, dark and smartly dressedT
She loosed on him a torrent of nervous, impatient
abuse. She was in great haste, she said. She was
already late. Why had he kept her waiting while
he amused himself pinching servant girls?</p>
<p>It was the vulgar performance of a well-bred
woman whose nerves w&rsquo;ere frayed.</p>
<p>Then Father d‚ÄôAstier proposed that they take
Mr. Winnery in the motor. Turning, he said, ‚ÄúIf
you go back in the fiacre you‚Äôll have no dinner until
nearly midnight.‚Äù</p>
<p>The driver of the fiacre grumbled at being de-
serted after darkness on a road so lonely, but Win-
nery, in an unbalanced moment of extravagance,
paid him for the whole journey and a little over and
he retired, still mumbling his indignation.</p>
<p>It was the Princess herself -who drove. She had
Father d‚ÄôAstier by her side and Mr. Winnery was
placed in the back with the sulking Enrico. They
bade Miss Fosdick good-night and the car suddenly
sprang forward with a wild roar, violating the si-
lence of the remote valley. The sound echoed and
re-echoed through the hills, shattering the strange
mood that had settled on Winnery. He was alive,
after all. It was the twentieth century. This was a
voiture de grand sport in which he had clearly found
a perilous seat.</p>
<p>It shot through the green tunnel at a terrifying
speed, so that the leaves whisked by with a hissihg
sound. Looking back he saw the black figure of
Miss Fosdick, still bearing the electric candle, dis-</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>appear into the copse of myrtle and and labur-
num. At the end of the drive, when they had
passed between the panthers and the fauns, he
turned again and there on the terrace beyond tiie
room where they had been sitting a little while be-
fore stood Mrs. Weatherby. In the thin moonlight
she w&rsquo;ould have been invisible save for the whiteness
of her gown. He thought she stood with her arms
held outstretched toward the sky, but he could not
make certain. The car suddenly shot ahead with a
wild roar. The Princess drove as if she were a mad
woman.</p>
<p>VIII</p>
<p>The ride back to Brinoe was much quicker, but no
less free from discomfort, than the ride out in the
fiacre. It was only a different sort of discomfort.
Winnery, who never rode in motors because he could
not afford it, felt that he was being shot through
Italy in a cannon-ball. There was no dust this time,
for the dust was left far behind, and even the dust
which remained on his clothes was blown away by
the very speed at which the big car hurtled along
the narrow roads. In Monte Salvatore and beyond,
the Princess set the strident German horn to shriek-
ing at each wall and turning. It was as if all the
violence of a wild, undisciplined nature had been
loosed. The big Grebel lights ate through dust and
darkness alike and presently Brinoe lay below them
huddled in the tight little valley and glowing faintly
in the moonlight, covered by a thick canopy of heat
and dust. The wind from Africa still blew.</p>
<p>Once inside the city the Princess was forced to</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>diive more slowly as the car, making rumbling
noises of impatience, turned and twisted through
the crooked streets. In the poor quarter they were
compelled suddenly to draw up altogether and stop
for a moment. In front of them, before the door
of an ancient palace, stood a crowd that filled the
street from side to side. It was the ancient Palazzo
Gonfarini where Miss Annie Spragg had died two
days before. The throng made way sullenly for
the big motor and as it passed the door of the palace
Winnery discerned in the dim light from a battered
jet of gas three figures ‚Äî a stout Italian woman lean-
ing on a broom made of twigs, a gigantic nun, and
a fat short little priest. These w&rsquo;cre no doubt the
janitress and Father Baldessare and Sister Annun-
ziata, the witnesses of the miracle. iVgainst the
grey wall just beneath the gaslight knelt the black
figures of tw&rsquo;o peasant women, praying.</p>
<p>Winnery shouted suddenly to the Princess, ‚ÄúI
will get down here. . . The car stopped abruptly
before the pastry-cake facade of St. Stefano and he
descended. Thanking them, he bade them good-
night. The car suddenly shot ahead, leaving him
on the sidewalk alone, knowing that he would never
see them again. They did not belong to his w&rsquo;orld.
They were not interested in him. They were gone
about their business and he felt a sudden wild pang
of literary curiosity. Where was the d‚ÄôOrobelli
bound in such haste? What would they be doing
that night? Why was her hand so feverish? Why
did it tremble so violently? WTere had they come
from? What tragedies, w&rsquo;hat delights, had touched
their lives? Why had they gone to the Villa</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>Leonardo? They &lsquo;were growing old, too, like liim-
self, and the d‚ÄôOrobelli was frightened.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as if awakening, he turned toward the
old palace where he occupied two shabby rooms.
Something odd had happened to him and he was
aware of it all at once with a sudden quickening of
the heart. He had gone up the hill feeling a bitter
and disappointed man, old at fifty and lost forev‚Äôer,
and now he felt suddenly no age at ail. It w‚Äôas as
if age did not exist. Even the boredom had van-
ished ‚Äî that awful boredom in which nothing inter-
ested him, in which everything lost its value and
slithered to a common level of monotony. There
were two things he w&rsquo;anted passionately. One was
to escape somehow from Brinoe and the other to
live a little before he died. It was becoming an
obsession with him. It seemed that until now he
had existed in a kind of literary spell completely de-
tached from reality, and now when he had begun
to be old he was aware of life.</p>
<p>He felt a disturbing desire to wander off alone in
search of adventure, moving in the constant ro-
mantic expectancy that something might happen to
him. He had no idea what it was he expected nor
what he would do with it when it arrived, but it
seemed to him that he could not go back to his flat
to unlock the door and find the same chairs, the
same books, even the same food that he had known
day after day in years of endless monotony. He
halted and turned abruptly, setting out for the
Piazza Garibaldi, where there were lights and music
and gaiety.</p>
<p>He had a poor dinner and some vinegary wine,</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>neithei&rsquo; of which seemed to matter greatly. He
listened to the sugary Italian music played abomi-
nably by a band seated under the arcade. ‚ÄúThe
Italians,‚Äù he thought bitterly, ‚Äúare a musical peo-
ple.‚Äù He listened to fragments of taik and fanned
himself because of the- heat. Yet he enjoyed him-
self as he had not done in years. He felt life stir-
ring about him. lie fell again to speculating upon
the mystery of such lives as Father d‚ÄôAstier‚Äôs and
the d‚ÄôOrobelli‚Äôs, which seemed so obvious and wxre
in reality so mysterious. lie thought of tl)at pre-
posterous woman Mrs. Weatherby and found him-
self wondering w/hat it w&rsquo;ould be like to love and be
loved, to have a home and wife and perhaps chil-
dren. Fie could not see why these things had never
occurred to him before and he thought himself a
little mad. Perhaps it w-as the heat and the hot
wind, and perhaps it was the queer change w‚Äôhich
had come over him lately. Indeed, he even blushed
a little in the darkness. He thought a great deal
about Miss Fosdick.</p>
<p>At last when he had finished dinner he went for a
walk in the moonlight along the river. The wind
had died dowm and it occurred to him suddenly that
in the moonlight Brinoe seemed as romantic as peo-
ple supposed it to be. In the moonlight even the
terrible equestrian statue of Victor Emmanuel
seemed romantic.</p>
<p>As he walked, his own past began to concern him
more and more as a sterile thing which had meant
nothing to the world and very little to himself, a
past filled with promise that had always seemed
foredoomed to disappointment. At twenty-four he</p>
<p>42 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>had been a brilliant and promising fellow. His
parodies and his verse had appeared in the Yellow
Book alongside the work of other men whose
promise had been fulfilled. People had taken him
up and asked him about ‚Äî him, the son of humble
parents, educated at Oxford by his uncle who made
a fortune as a ship chandler. Critics wrote of him
that ‚Äúhe struck a new note,‚Äù et cetera, et cetera.
He had been one of the literary radicals of his day.
And then suddenly something had happened and
people grew tired of him. No one wrote of him
any longer. The fashions changed and his sort of
thing was no longer wanted. The Yellow Book
died. And now all the parodies and verse lay en-
cased, forgotten and dusty, in copies of a periodical
filed away in dusty museums. It was a curiosity.
It all dated now. Nobody wanted that kind of
thing. It dated. It was older than the writing of
the Venerable Bede.</p>
<p>In all the symphony of literature he had been
able only to harp on one string and long ago that
string had grown flat and monotonous from too
much use.</p>
<p>Now for fifteen years he had been writing items
about the English who lived in Italy and about those
fashionable and gaudy creatures like the d‚ÄôOrobelli
and Father d‚ÄôAstier who passed through Florence
on their way from Rome to Paris or Rome to
Venice. He knew them not. He only wrote what
filtered down from their world into the duller cir-
cles which he frequented. Sometimes he wrote
querulous book reviews, mostly of travel books writ-
ten about Italy, and these, too, appeared in the</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>Ladies‚Äô Own World between advertisements for
scents and flesh reducers. It was all sordid and un-
worthy, but it helped to eke out the income given
him by Uncle Horace. Well, sometime he would
finish his book on Miracles. . . . Some day if he
had any money and could escape from the boredom
of Brinoe.</p>
<p>And then again when he had been on the verge of
inheriting all that mone}‚Äô&rsquo; from Uncle Horace the
old man chose in his dotage to marry a strumpet, a
cheap Cockney woman young enough to be his
granddaughter. Aunt Bessie! He thought of her
with disgust as he had seen her in the Temperance
Hotel in Bloomsbury on the day he went to buy her
off with promises of money after Uncle Horace
was dead. A yellow-haired slattern, fat and vulgar,
with a Cockney accent. But then Uncle Horace
had always been a common, vulgar old man. . . .
To leave all that income to her with the provision
that when she died it was to go on to him, her
nephew ! And that woman ‚Äî his Aunt Bessie ‚Äî was
ten years younger than himself and had the consti-
tution of an ox! No, he had been haunted by bad
luck. Nothing ever came out right. And now he
was nearly fifty-three. His life meant nothing to
himself or to anyone else. He had been a failure
and it was too late now to accomplish anything.
Nothing that mattered had ever happened to him.</p>
<p>IX</p>
<p>At eleven o‚Äôclock when he turned again toward
his own flat he went by way of the Palazzo Gon-</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE GF</p>
<p>fariiii, through crooked narrow streets, filled with
rubbish and smells, where shadows seemed thicker
than shadows should have been. The crowd before
the battered dooi-s of the old palace had thinned a
little, but there were still people there, gossiping
and looking up toward the window just beneath the
eaves, and near the doorway there were three de-
vout women kneeling in the dust beneath the room
of the mysterious old maid who would be burled to-
morrow.</p>
<p>All the way from the Gonfarini Palace to his own
flat Mr. Winnery tui&rsquo;ned over in his mind the power
of superstition, against which all the logic and the
intelligence in the world appeared to make no prog-
ress. There were things which science could not
yet explain, but some day it would explain all and
then in a moment of triumph superstition, religions,
churches, all would be swept away and man liberated
to command his own destiny untrammeled by dark
hei&rsquo;itages of the past. Some day he would finish his
book. For the moment he had at hand splendid
material, a laboratory, as it were, a perfect speci-
men in the case of Miss Annie Spragg. He would
go deeper and deeper into her story. Mrs.
Weatherby had not told everything. Clearly she
knew things she had chosen for some reason not to
tell.</p>
<p>His own flat was dark and after he had turned
on the light and turned down his bed, he discovered
that the charwoman had thrust a telegram under the
door. It might, he thought, have come from the
editor of the Ladies‚Äô Ozcn World asking for in-</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>formation of some special importance. He had
had such telegrams before. He picked it up and
opened it.</p>
<p>Your Aunt Bessie died tod.\y.</p>
<p>John Willis</p>
<p>Who was John Willis? For a moment he stood
quite still with the telegram in his hand, uncompre-
hending. Then for a second he felt suddenly ill.
And slowly it began to make sense to him.</p>
<p>Aunt Bessie was dead and he was a rich man.
His whole life was changed. He need no longer
live in Brinoe because he had no money. He need
no longer write grudging book reviews and bits of
gossip about people he did not known Aunt Bessie
was dead. Aunt Bessie, who was younger than him-
self and whom he had never expected to die. She
could not have been more than forty-two and she
had stood between him and his uncle‚Äôs w‚Äôeaith for
nearly twenty years. Aunt Bessie w/ith her Cockney
accent and low‚Äô&rsquo; manners who had kidnapped into
marriage a rich old man three times her age. All
that money was his. It was an act of God.</p>
<p>When he had recovered his senses a little, he sat
down at the table and stuck the telegram in the
letter-rack. He was a careful man and he knew
that when he wakened in the morning he wrould need
to see it there in order to believe that he had not
been dreaming.</p>
<p>Then his eye fell upon the pile of paper on which
was written his weekly correspondence for the
Ladies‚Äô Oivn World. An hour later he would have</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>taken his pen and added, ‚ÄúAmong those who paid
Brinoe fleeting visits during the month were Father
d‚ÄôAstier, the well-known dignitary, and Princess
Faustino d‚ÄôOrobelli. She wore, etc., etc., etc.‚Äù At
this season, when there was no one in Brinoe every
item was precious. Now he simply took up the pa-
pers and, tearing them twice across, threw them into
the waste-paper basket. Then, feeling the need of
air, he pushed open the windows and as he stood
there looking down at the river, he found himself
thinking of Miss Fosdick.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe is of a suitable age,‚Äù he thought. ‚ÄúNeither
too young nor too old. She is not a widow, so she
will have had no experience. Siie is innocent, more
innocent than myself. I must find out more about
her.‚Äù</p>
<p>As he turned away from the window it occurred
to him that all the evening he had been aware of
some vague thing disturbing himself and all the life
about him. Perhaps it was only because the wind
from Africa had died down at last.</p>
<p>He was intensely lonely.</p>
<p>THE MAN WHO BECAME GOD</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>O NE crisp autumn morning in the year 1840 a
little after dawn there appeared out of the
mists covering the Illinois prairies a great covered
wagon drawn by four oxen and guided by a man of
great physical power and beauty who woi-e his hair
cropped at the line of his shoulders and a black curl-</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>ing vigorous beard that covered his whole breast.
In the wagon rode his wife and the four children
which she had borne him in five years. Guiding the
oxen with a long pole, he walked beside the cart
much as Abraham in the glory of his strength
walked beside his flocks, erect and beautiful and
full of dignity. In his eyes there was a burning
light and on his arm he carried a great Bible fast-
ened and locked with brass clasps.</p>
<p>Beneath the ox-cart swung a crate filled with
shivering fowls and behind it walked a cow, a black
he-goat and two milking she-goats. He had come
from the Mormon settlement where a little while
before he had been publicly cast out for immoi&rsquo;al
practices. Behind him in the colony he left two
wives and three other children. The wife who slept
in the covered wagon wdth the nursing child in her
arms was his first wife, a woman called Maria
Trent, two years older than himself and the daugh-
ter of a fur trader of St. Louis. The youngest child
was a male child who had already been baptized by ,
his father in the waters of the Mississippi with the
name of Uriah.</p>
<p>On the outskirts of a shabby village the wanderer
halted his wagon, unyoked the oxen and set about
building a fire, and in a little wdiile a dozen early
morning risers wandering out from the village gath-
ered about to stare at him. Of these he took no
notice either by word or glance, but went on filling
an iron pot with water and oatmeal. This he hung
over the fire. Then he turned toward the wagon
and called out ‚ÄúMaria!‚Äù and a pale, sickly woman
with reddish hair opened the canvas and climbed</p>
<p>48 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>down carrying a baby in her arms. In turn the
stranger lifted down three small children, two boys
and a girl. When they had seated themselves on a
log beside the fire, the man turned his face toward
the sky and raising his mighty arms began to pray
in a voice of singular beauty.</p>
<p>For a moment the little crowd gathei&rsquo;ed about
the wagon became uneasy, as if looking upon some-
thing not meant for its eyes. One of the men
grinned with a self-consciousness rare in that crude
frontier world. And then slowly&rsquo; the voice and pres-
ence of the stranger began to work its effect upon
them. They were simple people and the words of
the stranger‚Äôs prayer were commonplace and filled
with noble expressions of a grandeur long since worn
threadbare by the mouthings of countless bad and
insincere preachers. But the same worn phrases in
the voice of this preacher became different.</p>
<p>‚ÄúO Lord of Hosts,‚Äù he prayed in the beautiful
voice, ‚Äúguide Thy poor children in their wanderings
through the wilderness. Look upon Thy poor
servant and humble him. Take him as Thy rod and
Thy staff to spread Thy truth like a morning sun
piercing the darkness. &hellip;‚Äù</p>
<p>He prayed for a long time and one by one the
three village women knelt on the frozen clay. One
of them threw off her shawl and flinging herself
down cried out, ‚ÄúForgive us our sins, O Lord.
Hallelujah. Forgive us our sins.‚Äù One of the men
began to pray and the others stood about in silence,
staring resentfully at the ground. The wife of Cy-
rus Spragg began to rock to and fro on the log,</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>silencing the baby Uriah, who had begun to cry with
cold and hunger.</p>
<p>When the stranger had finished, he opened his
eyes and looked round him with the empty stare of
one who had come back from a great distance.
Then the burning eyes rested in turn upon each of
the kneeling women, and he murmured, ‚ÄúArise, my
children, and go your ways, telling publicans and
sinners ye have found him on whom the Spirit of
the Lord is descended. Blessed be he who fills the
belly of the Prophet of God.‚Äù</p>
<p>They went away in silence and in a little while
the three Avomen returned bringing w‚Äôith them two
boys who cai-ried bags of beans and potatoes, late
melons and bread and a quarter of fresh mutton.
These they laid beside the fire and then one of the
women, a plump and handsome young thing, pulled
her shawl more closely over her yellow hair and
speaking in a low, timid voice said, ‚ÄúWill you come
and preach for us. Reverend? It‚Äôs been a long spell
since we had a good preacher.‚Äù There was a curi-
ous hot excitement in her voice.</p>
<p>When they had gone again the woman on the log
looked up at her husband with the strangest expres-
sion. In her eyes there was the light of admiration,
but the thin mouth curled as if in derision. She was
the only woman in the world who knew this man,
and she could not bring herself to leave him.</p>
<p>n</p>
<p>He stayed and preached. His wife played for
the services on a melodion which they carried in the</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>covered wagon- Each night brought souls to God.
Each night brought singing and weeping. In that
little town ail came to God save one old man whose
deafness shut him out from the sonorous beauty of
Cyrus Spragg‚Äôs voice and whose blindness hung a
veil between him and fire in the preacher‚Äôs eyes.
They came to him, each one, in secret to ask for-
giveness from their sins. He was to them the
Prophet of God.</p>
<p>Fie left at last with his ox-cart and chickens and
goats, his wife and children, and he took with him
a store of food and a young heifer bred and due
to calve the following spring, and on the day he left
a little crowd followed the covered Tirngon for three
miles beyond the village, and in it were w‚Äôomen weep-
ing and crying out hysterically. When at last he
took leave of them at the ford in a muddy prairie
stream, he stood on the back of the wagon and
made a long prayer while they knelt on the frozen
turf. And when he had finished he said, ‚ÄúAnd God
came to His servant in a dream and said, ‚ÄòGo ye into
the v/ilderness and when ye find a place where three
streams meet, there shall ye found a new kingdom
which shall be called the New Jerusalem. And it
shall flourish and flow with milk and honey, and to
all the faithful the founding of the kingdom will be
revealed by a sign, and the faithful shall sell all
and leave their homes and firesides, their wives and
husbands, nay even their children, and come at last
into the Kingdom of Heaven.‚Äô ‚Äù</p>
<p>Then he blessed them all and taking up the long
wand by which he guided the oxen, set out through
the water to cross the ford. One woman, the plump</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>comely one who had spoken to him on the first morn-
ing, rushed into the cold water up to her knees, but
he turned her back saying, ‚ÄúUntil the Lord send you
a sign, tend your hearth and your home.‚Äù</p>
<p>Inside the wagon the wife lay with her face buried
in a new feather-bed, her fingers pressed against her
ears. She was sobbing and ill and pregnant with
another child of the Prophet.</p>
<p>And in the village early In the following summer,
the plump blonde woman gave birth to a child which
she said was not her husband‚Äôs child, but the child
of God and that she must take it to the Prophet.
Some thought her mad and some whispered about
her, and her husband hired a woman to keep watch
over her while he worked In the fields, but one day
when he had gone to Chicago she escaped, and with
the child joined a wagon-train bound westward and
they never heard of her again.</p>
<p>Ill</p>
<p>The tale of Cyrus Spragg is a legend of the fiat .
country, of those prairies of the Middle West
where one can travel for days discovering only
monotony, and the origin of Cyrus Spragg is as mys-
terious as his end. No one ever knew whence he
came and none knows when he died. There Is no
record of his grave. Some said that he was a
gypsy, but he was far too massive in build for one
of the^ Romany race. Others said that he was the
son of a French-Canadian father and a New Eng-
land mother, and others that he was of German
origin, the son of immigrants from the Palatinate,</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<dl>
<dt>and still others that he was the son of a white man</dt>
<dd>and an Indian woman. It is known only that he</dd>
<dt>came out of the wilderness somewhere on the bor-</dt>
<dt>ders of Canada. It is likely that he had Indian</dt>
<dt>; ; blood and that it was the blood of the Five Nations.</dt>
<dd>
<p>&rsquo; ^ But there is little chance that the truth will ever be</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>, known, for the Spraggites ceased to exist half a</p>
<p>century ago. The sect died when it no longer had
\ a God and those remaining alive who saw him in</p>
<p>life never knew anything of his origin,
ijl The first existing record of his physical appear-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;i ance is to be found in the works of Miss Amelia</p>
<p>I i Bossert, a lady of a highly emotional nature who</p>
<p>&rsquo; became the poetess and historian of the Spraggite</p>
<p>!&rsquo; sect as well as the mother of three children by the</p>
<p>i Prophet. After she had passed middle age and was</p>
<p>no longer attractive she quarrelled with the sect and
I was publicly expelled from the colony. But her</p>
<p>I : Impressions had been written as a girl and having</p>
<p>. been already printed and distributed she found it</p>
<p>I impossible to collect and destroy them. She -was</p>
<p>seventeen at the time when Cyrus Spragg first en-
j&rsquo; tered her life. She saw him on the morning he</p>
<p>|; entered Valencia, Illinois, driving a wagon-train</p>
<dl>
<dt>laden with food and household furniture sent West</dt>
<dd>Into the frontier country by an enterprising Phila-</dd>
</dl>
<p>&rsquo; delphia merchant. She must even then have been a</p>
<p>I : ; woman of an hysterical nature easily susceptible to</p>
<p>a faith which rested upon outbursts of wild religious
ecstasy. There was a great deal In her account that
was significant.</p>
<p>She wrote : ‚ÄúHe was a handsomely made man of
about six feet two inches with a remarkable high-</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>colored, full-blooded look, with fiery black eyes and
black curling hair which he wore cropped so that
it fell just below the ears. In weight he was much
heavier than he appeared because he was a muscular
man of huge physical strength fashioned in such
grandeur of proportion as might have been chosen
by Fidias or one of the Greeks (sic). His brow
was open and noble and his nose large and straight
with elegant nostrils. These nostrils were always
a little distended as I have remarked is the case with
men of virility and passion of purpose. The lips
were of a fine strawberry red and finely shaped
though I have heard it said they were too full for
some tastes. His hands were large and powerful,
but of a beautiful shape, although hard and cal-
loused from the powerful and heavy work v/hich his
truly Democratic (sic) nature craved warmly.
Though he was but nineteen he had the mien and
dignity of a well-developed man of forty.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn his countenance there was already the light
of Godhood. His were the flashing eyes of a man
born to command as the Prophet of God. People
on whom the Great Light had descended knew him
at once as the leader sent by God to conduct His
children out of the black slough of this world‚Äôs sin
and despair. A great light shone from his counte-
nance. Many times since, the sight of him has called
to mind those noble words of Solomon in describing
God‚Äôs love for the Church :</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòHis eyes are the eyes of doves by the river of
waters, washed with milk, and fitly set.</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòHis cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet</p>
<p>54 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>flowers; his lips like lilies dropping sweet-smelling
myrrh.</p>
<p>&quot; &ldquo;His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl,</p>
<p>&ldquo;‚Äò‚ÄòHis legs are as pillars of marble set upon
sockets of fine gold; his countenance is as Lebanon,
excellent as the cedars.‚Äô ‚Äù</p>
<p>Miss Bossei-t, perhaps through a modesty which
appears to have deserted her later in life, saw fit to
delete one sentence of the passage. She writes that
she saw him for the first time when she was standing
in front of Petersen‚Äôs General Store, where she had
been sent to buy eggs by her afterward sainted
mother.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile I stood watching him with all the curi-
osity which we in Valencia felt for each newcomer,
he lifted single-handed out of the rut into which it
had sunk a whole laden ox-cart which two oxen had
been unable to move.‚Äù</p>
<p>Of that first appearance in Valencia there is no
further record, but from Miss Bossert‚Äôs description
it is easy to see that he was no usual frontier youth.
It may have been that he had in Valencia one of
those adventures which later marked his progress
back and forth across the face of the Middle West,
but Miss Bossert, being at that time only seventeen,
would scarcely have heard of it. Her own adven-
ture came much later.</p>
<p>From Valencia he went westward to sell what re-
mained of his store of commerce and then for nine
years he appears to have been lost, like Saint John
the Baptist, In the wilderness. They were years
spent perhaps in trading and trapping. Throughout</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>his life he was surrounded from time to time by
complete mystery. At the end of the nine years he
appeared in Saint Louis, where he married Maria
Trent and began his long career as a religious ex-
perimenter and itinerant preacher.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>For thirty years from the day the Moranons
cast him out Cyrus Spragg and his e%^er-increasing
family wandered the frontier country, appearing
now here, now there, bringing with him excitement
and romance and ecstasy where other-wise there was
only poverty and work. As he grew older and more
certain of himself, a kind of conscious glory came to
envelop him, so that at times his journeying took on
the aspect of a royal progress. Villages came to
await his coming. Twice there were scandals that
became known. Once in Mississippi he was forced
to flee before the threats of an outraged husband
across the border into Tennessee, leaving his family
and his ox-cart to follow him. And each year the
tired pretty woman who was his wife bore him an-
other child until at length there were thirteen.</p>
<p>They were strong children, full of vitality, who
thrived on the abundant food given by those to
whom Cyrus Spragg had brought the light. He had
other children, beyond all doubt ‚Äî -children like that
of the plump yellow-haired woman who had dis-
appeared seeking the Prophet. They were scat-
tered throughout the borders of the Middle West.
There were thirteen by his wife and three by the
two deserted Mormon wives and countless others</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>not included among those he sired after he ruled as
God in New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The wife, it seemed, could not bring herself to
leave him, perhaps because without him she could
not have fed all those mouths, perhaps because in
the end, after he had come to believe in himself, she,
too, began to believe that he might be God. Or it
may have been a thing even simpler and less com-
plex, that he had for her that fascination which he
had for other women, like Miss Amelia Bossert and
the yellow-haired wife.</p>
<p>The children had Biblical names ‚Äî ^Jared and
Obadiah, Vashti and Uriah, Solomon and Bath-
sheba, Joshua and Isaiah, Boaz and Sulamith, Abra-
ham and Ishmael ‚Äî all save the last. For some rea-
son the tired woman rebelled against giving the last
a Biblical name. Perhaps it was because she had
some foreknowledge that she would never have an-
other child and so sought to have one that might
be her own instead of his. Perhaps she knew even
before it was born that the last child was destined
to be strange and different from the others.</p>
<p>The child was born one hot August night in a
cottonwood grove in Iowa. There was a clear sky
with a red moon that came up out of the flat prairie
as the sun disappeared. The tired woman felt the
pains coming on and begged her husband to stop
for the night among the pleasant trees. She could
not bear a child far out alone on that flat monoto-
nous plain with not even a bush to hide her agony.
And when she had seen to it that the smaller chil-
dren were asleep and the older ones had wandered
off among the trees, she went with Cyrus Spragg</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>deep into the grove until they came to a swamp
bordered round with deep thickets of witch-hazel,
and there in the wildest corner they made a bed of
leaves and blankets under the trees and Cyrus
heated water in an iron pot.</p>
<p>Her pain lasted all through the night, to the wild
accompaniment of frogs croaking in the marshes
and white herons moving about and chortling in
their sleep. A single coyote somewhere on the edge
of the marsh sat on his haunches and bayed at the
moon, long quivering wails that came surely from
another world. It seemed that the child would
never be born and that surely she must die, but when
morning came and the moon had disappeared and
only ‚ÄòVenus hung red in the pale East, Cyrus Spragg
tore the child from its mother‚Äôs womb. It was a
girl and it lived, but the tired mother knew she could
never have another child.</p>
<p>They baptized the baby in the waters of the
marsh, giving it the name of Annie, which was the
name of Maria Spragg‚Äôs mother.</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>In the years that followed, revelations that were
false came from time to time to the Prophet. Once
he returned from meditation in the wilderness de-
claring that God had come to him in a pillar of fire
to say that mankind could alone be saved by turning
again to the ways of the birds and the beasts of the
field. There must be no more marrying or giving
in marriage and man must go about clothed only in
his skin, like the birds and the beasts. Sin, God told</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>Cyrus Spragg, was bom of the garments with which
man covered his body.</p>
<p>With his family and a little band of followers he
set up a kingdom of Nature in the dunes and forests
of Michigan. But two things he had failed to con-
sider. The winter came and with it forty-seven
Vigilantes from the nearest town. Together they
dispersed the little band. Among the followers was
Miss Amelia Bossert, the poetess, who early in the
summer of the next year bore a son to the glory of
the Prophet. The tired wife was released at last
from the servitude of her body.</p>
<p>And then again at Cairo, Illinois, God came to
him in the shape of a ram speaking with the tongues
of angels to warn him against the new deluge.
From the back of the great ox-cart he preached re-
pentance and destruction, and beside it he and his
followers set about building a clumsy barge that
would have sunk as soon as launched. The great
ship was finished in November and he settled him-
self to waiting for the rains to descend and the
waters to rise. It is true that in that year the rains
came and the rivers in the Middle West rose higher
than they had ever risen before; but the Ark re-
mained on dry land. No trickle of water touched
it, despite even the prayers of all his band of fol-
lowers. On the eighth day the river subsided again.</p>
<p>He did not wait for new floods, but told his fol-
lowers that he had been guilty of error and sin and
so had been blind to the true meaning of God‚Äôs
revelation, and packing his family into the cart, he
disappeared again, moving toward the west with a
small band of eccentric disciples. The Ark re-</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>mained, a curiosity which farmers drove miles to
see, and at last it was carried off piecemeal for fire-
wood by the negroes who lived on the riverbanks.</p>
<p>VI</p>
<p>In the spring of the following year the little cara-
van led by the Prophet came suddenly upon ‚Äúthe
spot where three rivers joined their waters.‚Äù He
was no longer a young man and no longer quite a
charlatan. At sixty-one he had come to believe in
himself as others believed in him. The thing he
had created took possession of him. The site where
three rivers joined their waters was the spot indi-
cated by him in a prophecy thirty years earlier. He
had not believed it then, and now it had come true.
It was as if God had chosen him, after all. Here
he unyoked the oxen for the last time. This v/as the
New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>It was a fertile country, green and well watered,
with deep black soil, though it was a flat country
and treeless and bare. The land was to be had for
the taking. At this time there were in his train
seven grown sons and nineteen followers, men and
women, and among them they claimed land larger
in area than all Judea. Cyrus Spragg became the
ruler and the patriarch and throughout the prairie
country those who had been awaiting a sign heard
of the New Jerusalem and left their homes and
flocked to join him. They came for days and weeks
in wagons and ox-carts, on foot and on horseback,
a restless, emotional people seeking the compensa-
tion of a romantic faith.</p>
<p>6o</p>
<p>JHE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>He built a Temple of which Miss Amelia Bos-
sert‚Äôs description remains. It was eight-sided, with-
out windows, and possessed a single door. Inside
there were no dividing walls, hut only draperies and
curtains. What light there was came through the
roof, which rose to a height of a hundred feet in a
gigantic dome-topped tower that was visible for
miles across the flat prairie from any part of New
Jerusalem. Near it he built the Ecclesiastical
Palace, a rambling wooden house painted white,
that was to shelter his wife, his six daughters, his
seven sons and daughters-in-law and his eighteen le-
gitimate grandchildren. It was the first house his
tired wife had known in forty years and when it was
finished she took to a bed placed near a window that
gave out on the square before the Temple. There
she lived, wearing out her tired life in watching with
dimmed but uncomplaining eyes this strange thing
built up out of nothing by the strange man she
had loved and despised for nearly forty years.
Neither the thing nor the man had she ever under-
stood.</p>
<p>When the Temple and the Palace were finished
there was a great service in the open air. Cyrus
Spragg was photographed and took leave of his
followers and entered into the Temple, to pass
eternity in repose and meditation. God, he told
them, would rule New Jenasalera through His in-
strument, Cyrus Spragg. He would send out revela-
tions from time to time administering the sowing
of crops and price of grain and the shearing of
sheep. As God‚Äôs instrument, Cyrus Spragg oould
not die. He would live forever in the depths of the</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>6i</p>
<p>Temple watching over their good. There would be
only virgins to serve him, virgins to carry forth his
revelations into the light, virgins to feed him and
attend his will. Then he entered into the Temple
and no man ever saw him again. He became an
Invisible Presence and there were converts to the
faith and children born in New Jerusalem who had
never seen Cyrus Spragg and so came to think of
him as God.</p>
<p>But in New Jerusalem dissension and wrangling
broke out even in the family of the Prophet himself,
for his third son, Uriah, was unlike the others and
would take no part in the plan, and went about
muttering against his father. He and the Prophet‚Äôs
youngest daughter, Annie Spragg, who never left
the side of her mother, talked bitterly against their
father, even though their brothers upbraided and
beat them, until at last the tired mother, with her
favorite children, Uriah and Annie, left the squab-
bles of the Palace and went to live by themselves in
a house on the borders of the colony. It was there
the defeated old woman died at last calling on the
Prophet to leave the Temple and visit her. But he
never came, for God could not appear among his
people. When she was buried, Uriah Spragg and
his sister fled the colony one dark night, and with
them went Miss Amelia Bossert and her four sons,
for she was an old woman now and when the
Prophet failed to choose her among those to serve
him in the Temple, she uttered blasphemies that
caused her to be driven from New Jerusalem. She
went to Omaha to live and supported her four sons
by sewing. One of them became a senator.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>When the Prophet was sixty-eight God sent him
a revelation saying that it was through his seed that
the world would be redeemed and that all his chil-
dren would be blessed unto the fifth and sixth gen-
eration as the chosen and the true Children of God.
It became a great honor for any woman to be chosen
as the mother of God‚Äôs children.</p>
<p>VII</p>
<p>There lived in a house not far from the Temple a
young woman of twenty called Eliza Weatherby,
the daughter of one of the Prophet‚Äôs oldest con-
verts. She was a pretty girl, devout and serious,
but not without vanity. She sinned by wearing
bi&rsquo;ooches and bright ribbons, and so she attracted
many admirers. Her father‚Äôs house adjoined the
building where the produce of New Jerusalem was
sold and the mail given out. Through this circum-
stance she made the acquaintance of a young man,
the only unbeliever who was ever allowed within
the sacred ground of the colony. He was tall and
straight and lean and a Kentuckian. Pie was a hard
rider and employed by the government to bring the
mail from Omaha west across the prairies to New
Jerusalem. For Miss Eliza Weatherby he con-
ceived a romantic Southern passion which appears
to have excited the girl, perhaps because it was so
free of all the piety which surrounded the dour
courtships of the Faithful. For New Jerusalem was
a moral community where tiiere was no dancing or
gambling and no drinking of alcohol, and adultery
was punished by expulsion from the sect. But the</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 63</p>
<p>girl resisted him because she could not marry an
infidel and urged him to become converted.</p>
<p>The suitor was a young man and quite out of his
head with love and desire for the pretty Eliza
Weatherby and at length, when she remained firm,
he was driven beyond endurance. He expressed a
desire to be converted and under Obadiah Spragg,
eldest son of the Prophet, he began a course of in-
struction. What he learned there was never known,
for the secrets of the sect were well guarded, but it
caused him to violate the Temple. He discovered
that Eliza was among the virgins chosen to serve
the Prophet and on the day she was called to enter
the sanctuary the Kentuckian broke in the door. A
passing woman heard three shots of a pistol and
saw him emerge and leap on his horse and ride off,
not toward Omaha but toward the West. A little
while later Eliza Weatherby ran screaming into the
street crying out that her lover had murdered God.</p>
<p>A crowd gathered about the Temple, but none
dared enter to violate its sanctity save the woman
chosen to serve on that day, and as Eliza Weatherby
had fallen into a faint that lasted until nightfall,
she could not enter. So they waited, praying until
morning of the next day, when the young woman
chosen went into the Temple. All day they waited
for her to emerge and when at last she came out she
bore a revelation written by the Prophet. It read,
‚ÄúFear not, my people. Thy God is immortal.‚Äù The
young woman told them that a darkness had de-
scended upon the Temple and that she had not seen
the Prophet‚Äôs face.</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>There was great rejoicing in the colony, and out
of death Cyrus Spragg wrung a greater faith.</p>
<p>But before six months had passed murmurs be-
gan to arise in New Jerusalem. The revelations of
the Prophet had caused the crops to freeze out of
the ground, and ewes to be bred too early so that
the Iambs died of cold. There came a great plague
of grasshoppers which ate v&gt;^hat was left of the
wheat. Among the chosen women who served the
Prophet other strange murmurs arose, that now he
received them only in the darkness of the innermost
chamber and that his manner was strange. Eliza
Weatherby, who had become pregnant and seemed
a little out of her head, made the hysterical state-
ment that the Prophet no longer existed and that an
impostor had taken his place. But they held her in
disfavor for having loved an infidel and so having
been the cause of all their misfortunes, and no one
believed her. She was tried and, being expelled
from the colony by the Prophet‚Äôs eldest son for
blasphemy, went to Des Moines to live, where she
embraced a literary career and wrote book reviews
for the newspapers.</p>
<p>But in the end it was a thing as simple, and com-
monplace as jealousy that destroyed the strange
kingdom of Cyrus Spragg. One day in the midst of
worship before the Temple the wife of Obadlah
Spragg rose and cried out wildly that the Prophet
was dead and that an impostor had taken his place.
And then turning upon one of the female followers
who had been shown special favor by the Prophet
she began to scratch and pull the woman‚Äôs hair and
call her all manner of evil names. When they had</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>6S</p>
<p>calmed her and Obadiah Spragg had bade her be
silent, she turned and, pointing her finger, screamed
at him: ‚ÄúThere is the False Prophet. Him and his
brother Jared. It took two of them to fill the place
of the True Prophet. One wasn‚Äôt good enough.‚Äù</p>
<p>In their fear that God had chosen them for
calamity the colony held a meeting in the open space
before the Temple and four of the oldest followers
of the Prophet, with prayer on their lips and despite
the cries of ‚ÄúSacrilege‚Äù from Jared and Obadiah
Spragg, opened the door and entered the Temple.
At the end of an hour they appeared again with
terror in their eyes. The Temple was empty.
There was no Prophet.</p>
<p>It was the end of the colony. Some sold their
land and went away from the accursed ground and
some stayed until better times brought prosperity.
But the Spraggites were no more, and no one knows
to this day what became of Cyrus Spragg. His son
Obadiah declared that he had been taken to Heaven
in a chariot of fire, but Obadiah was not Cyrus
Spragg and he had neither the vigor nor the beauty
nor the voice of Cyrus Spragg and none believed
him.</p>
<p>In Des Moines the child of Eliza Weatherby was
born. It was a boy and sickly, the child of the Prop-
het‚Äôs old age. She christened it Alonzo for the Ken-
tuckian and because she thought Alonzo a pretty
name. But she refused to marry her lover. She
died in the belief that he had murdered God.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>TWENTY YEARS OF DEVOTION</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>A S MRS. WEATHERBY had explained, food
meant little to her ; it was rather the things of
the spirit in which she found satisfaction. There
were two reasons for this, one, that she really had
no taste for food and could not distinguish good
food from bad, and the other, that no matter how
great her efforts, no matter the number of Yogi ex-
ercises which she practiced, it was impossible to keep
her majestic figure within bounds. The trouble was
with her glands.</p>
<p>The night after her strange callers had gone off
in the black and red motor of the Princess d‚ÄôOro-
belli she and Miss Fosdick seated themselves to a
dinner of veal and spaghetti and wilted salad served
by the same Margharita who a little while earlier
had been pinched by the chauffeur of the Princess.
There was also a little of that acid wine which Italy
produces in vast quantities. Miss Fosdick hated
veal and from a too great familiarity detested
spaghetti. She liked good food and only once in two
years, when she had escaped secretly to a restaurant,
had she tasted it.</p>
<p>But the meal was a little better than usual be-
cause Mrs. Weatherby was in high spirits over the
success of the afternoon and the glory reflected upon
her as the sole existing friend of Miss Annie Spragg.
For Miss Fosdick this was a condition as rare as
good food. The sweet disposition, the poise, the</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 67</p>
<p>trained smile and the throaty voice, the sweet ex-
pression which Mrs. Weatherby exhibited to the
world‚Äî all these were bought at a cost, paid in the
beginning by Alonzo Weatherby and after his death
by Miss Fosdick. All her ill temper was poured out
upon their heads.</p>
<p>She observed to Miss Fosdick that Father d‚ÄôAs-
tier was a devout and charming man, that the Prin-
cipessa was a woman of great distinction and that
Mr. WInnery (although he had scarcely uttered a
word) was a man of great intelligence.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe must do something about the villa,‚Äù she
said, ‚Äúnow that we have begun to receive people.‚Äù</p>
<p>She watched Miss Fosdick. She had a way of
watching her companion as if to measure how much
she might be told, for one could not afford to betray
oneself to a companion. But as both grew older
Miss Fosdick appeared to notice less and less what
happened about her. She was, after all, (reflected
Mrs. Weatherby) a perfect companion, docile and
admiring, never intruding her own personality, and,
most important of all, she was a companion who
could not quit her place. Miss Fosdick no longer
even gave in to those fits of hysterical weeping which
had been so trying, or if she did weep, she wept in
private where it would not disturb anyone. ‚ÄúWhat
would the poor lamb have done without me?‚Äù
thought Mrs. Weatherby. ‚ÄúShe would have been
helpless in this world, probably doing sewing by the
day in Winnebago Falls. She is only a child, affter</p>
<p>They sat In the grand salon wlth^lhe ,S.qp,erb view
over the valley because as</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE GF</p>
<p>for the dining-room. From time to time Mrs.
Weatherby would lean over and murmur, ‚ÄúDo Too-
Too and Lulu want to eat?‚Äù at which the two
Pomeranians, yapping, would spring into the air to
snap at the piece of veal she held on her fork. The
candles burned without a flicker in the still hot air
and Margharita shufiled in and out noiselessly in
felt slippers. It was the same night after night.
This was the middle of August and it had been
exactly the same every night since the middle of
May. On the opposite side of the table Miss Fos-
dick stared out of her round eyes across the dark
valley. The excitement of callers had made her a
little seasick, so that she was uncertain whether she
could eat or not. She thought, ‚ÄúI shall go insane.
I can stand it no longer.‚Äù</p>
<p>Mrs. Weatherby continued eating the tired let-
tuce. ‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt listening, Gertrude. I said we
niust do something about the dining-room, now that
visitors have begun to come.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe might drive into Brinoe tomorrow.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúNot in this heat. You know how this heat af-
fects you. I shouldn‚Äôt mind it. If you could only
believe as I do, the heat would have no effect upon
you.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúPerhaps we‚Äôd better leave it until next year. It‚Äôs
so late in the season.‚Äù (This, Miss Fosdick knew,
was what she was meant to say.)</p>
<p>‚ÄúYes, next year,‚Äù echoed Mrs. Weatherby, and
then tartly, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt seem to take any interest in
anything any more.‚Äù</p>
<p>Next year (thought Miss Fosdick) they would
come out here and live in the same dreary fashion.</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>Nothing would be done. And no one would come
to see them except some crazy woman who would
talk magnetism and spirit control. And next year
and next year and next year. &hellip;</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt listen I might as well go to bed.
Considering all I do for you. &hellip;‚Äù</p>
<p>Miss Fosdick never heard the end of the sentence,
for Mrs. Weatherby, in one of her sudden tempers,
had rushed out of the door, followed by the yap-
ping Pomeranians. On her way she knocked over
her chair and the sound of it striking the stone floor
echoed through the empty villa long after she had
gone. Miss Fosdick‚Äôs expression did not change.
There was a buzzing in her head. The room seemed
suddenly to swell to enormous proportions and then
contract again. She lifted the tired lettuce to her
mouth and ate mechanically. Everything was so
still and breathless and hot. ‚ÄúI shall go mad,‚Äù she
thought. ‚ÄúI shall go mad.‚Äù</p>
<p>It was the return of Margharita that brought her
out of the sudden trance. She decided that she was
glad of the quarrel, for it gave her a chance to be
alone for a little time. If she stayed away long
enough Aunt Henrietta would send for her and then
when she came. Aunt Henrietta would sulk and re-
fuse to talk. Anything was better than talking,
feeding, feeding, feeding, the vanity of Aunt Hen-
rietta. What the world failed to give her Miss Fos-
dick was forced to supply, and at the moment the
world of Brinoe was simply ignoring Mrs.
Weatherby.</p>
<p>Then suddenly Miss Fosdick thought with a pang,
‚ÄúI have been rude and ungrateful. We are two</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>women alone together in the world. I must not
forget that. I owe her everything in the world.
But for her I shouldnT be here in this beautiful
spot, In this interesting and historic country.‚Äô‚Äô But
almost at once she was overcome with a loathing for
the villa, for Brinoe, for all of Italy. She had^ to
live there. She could see no way of ever escaping
this alien, unsympathetic land where everything
seemed romantic and untidy, fantastically beautiful
and reeking with smells.</p>
<p>‚ÄòTf only I could speak Italian,‚Äù she thought, ‚ÄòT
could at least talk to the servants now and then. I
must try and learn next winter.‚Äù</p>
<p>But she knew she never would learn. She had
never learned anything. There was nothing, she
told herself, that she could do. She was not clever
enough.</p>
<p>^T will go out Into the garden until I‚Äôve recovered
my temper.‚Äù</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>In the garden the air seemed cool and there was
a smell of fresh earth coming from the trench that
had been dug for the cesspool. The moon had risen
to the top of the sky and its light fell full upon the
roof of fading plantain leaves, so that the carpet of
moss below was flecked all over with a pattern of
silver. Usually she was afraid at night in the gar-
den, with that fear of darkness and the unknown
that had paralyzed her timid nature since childhood.
And there was something special about this garden.
She always had a feeling of being watched by invisi-
ble eyes. It was too old, too haunted by Its incal-</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>cuiable antiquity. But tonight the shadows seemed
less ominous and the faint whispering of the leaves
even friendly. It may have been the light showing
from the servants‚Äô wing that gave her courage, or
it may have been a sudden overwhelming conviction
that anything was better than talking to Aunt Hen-
rietta.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI must not think that,‚Äù she told herself. ‚ÄúAunt ,
Henrietta is right. It is evil thoughts that destroy
us and make us old. &hellip; But what difference does
it make whether I am old or not ? Nothing can ever
happen to me. I am thirty-eight years old and noth-
ing has ever happened. I am getting fat and no
man would ever look at me even if I had the chance
to know one.</p>
<p>‚ÄúStill,‚Äù she thought, blushing a little, ‚Äúthat Mr.
Winnery did look at me today.‚Äù</p>
<p>She found herself presently at a spot in the gar-
den where the jasmine climbed over the pitted stone
balustrade that overhung the deep valley. A few
pale blossoms still gleamed in the moonlight and the
fragrance drifted through the still air under the
colonnades of trees. The scent came to her vaguely,
awakening and sharpening her senses and drawing
her thoughts away from herself. Leaning over
the balustrade she broke off a blossom and smelled
of it, half dreaming. ‚ÄúThat Mr. Winnery who was
her today. . . . He was polite to me. But I shan‚Äôt
ever see him again.‚Äù</p>
<p>She turned away and wandered down one of the
long allies, but after a few steps she halted and
thrusting the jasmine blossom into her hair, patted
it smooth again and then set off, following the wall.</p>
<p>72 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>She walked a long way half-dreaming, half-aware
that far down in the bottom of the valley on the
opposite side there was an automobile moving along
the lonely road toward Monte Salvatore. The dis-
tant sound of the motor drifted up from the valley
below, and then all at once she was aware that the
sound had stopped and that the car was not moving.
It sat quite still at a point almost directly opposite
the villa. It seemed an odd place to stop, in the
very midst of an empty valley where there was no
inn, no house and nothing but rocks and olive trees.</p>
<p>Watching it, she thought again of Mr. Winnery.
He was a small man and not handsome, but he had
nice manners and a kind face. It would be nice to
know that. &hellip; It would be pleasant to feel safe.
. . . Her thoughts went silly and muddled and she
found herself blushing in the darkness. Surely she
was going mad.</p>
<p>How long she stood there dreaming she did not
know, but presently she was aware of the familiar
terrifying certainty that she was no longer alone.
The light in the servants‚Äô wing had gone out. It
was as if something were watching her out of the
shadows. A wild impulse stronger than her own
terror compelled her to turn and look fearfully over
her shoulder, and then she discovered that she was
standing a dozen feet from the new-found statue.
It lay against the black ilex, white and glisten-
ing in the moonlight. She saw the face with an ex-
traordinary clearness and all the too rich beauty of
the voluptuous body. For a time she remained fas-
cinated and chilled with terror, and then in the most
unmaidenly fashion she gathered up her skirts and</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>ran toward the darkened villa. Once inside the
door she fell upon the stone flagging and lay there
so overcome by panic that she was unable to rise.</p>
<p>Ill</p>
<p>At ten o‚Äôclock, sitting in the vast empty room
which she called her boudoir Mrs. Weatherby lost
patience and began ringing the great brass bell with
which she was accustomed to summon the servants.
Not only was she out of patience, but disturbed.
Miss Fosdick had never before remained away sulk-
ing for so long a time, and there came to Mrs.
Weatherby that faint and unlikely suspicion which
sometimes raised its head, that her companion might
have run away.</p>
<p>She had not gone. There was a timid knock on
the door and Miss Fosdick entered, looking, Mrs.
Weatherby thought, pale and agitated.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt seems to me, Gertrude, that you‚Äôre old enough
not to sulk.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt sulking. Aunt Henrietta.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve finished my exercises long ago. I thought
you were never coming.‚Äù</p>
<p>Miss Fosdick did not answer, but took up the
hair-brush and began her nightly task of soothing
Mrs. Weatherby‚Äôs frayed nerves. The large empty
room was lighted by two candles and an oil-lamp
which stood on the dressing-table before an antique
mirror in which Mrs. Weatherby‚Äôs countenance
gazed out, blotched and hazy, from the age not so
much of Mrs. Weatherby‚Äôs face as of the quick-
silver. The great religious experimenter had</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>changed into a white peignoir trimmed with white
maribou. The exercises to which she referred were
a series of facial contortions which she practiced
each night for forty-five minutes in order to give
firmness to the muscles of the face and sweetness to
the expression. ‚ÄúEverything by nature,‚Äù was her
creed, and ‚Äúthe power of mind over matter.‚Äù No
flake of pov/der, no morsel of rouge, no cream of
any sort, had ever touched her face and so her skin
had that weather-beaten, tough look that marks the
skin of those firm women who are above vanities.</p>
<p>Miss Fosdick, brushing the hair slowly (eight
strokes to the minute was Mrs. Weatherby‚Äôs
formula) was having bitter thoughts. ‚ÄúWhy,‚Äù she
asked herself, ‚Äúshould she want to keep young?
Certainly it is not to attract men. She hates the
attention of men. Maybe she wants people to re-
mark how young she looks for sixty-five.‚Äù And al-
most at once she reproached herself for having
thoughts so lewd, disloyal and cynical.</p>
<p>At the same time Mrs. Weatherby was thinking,
‚ÄúNow is a time when I wish Gertrude had some
sense. I‚Äôd like to talk over this conversion affair,
but I can‚Äôt risk it.‚Äù</p>
<p>It was one of the times when the indomitable
woman was put to rout by the very simplicity of her
companion. She spoke again without turning, ‚ÄúYou
haven‚Äôt changed your mind?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo, Aunt Henrietta. I tried praying but I got
no answer.‚Äù</p>
<p>Mrs. Weatherby answered her with a snort and
the pair fell back into silence. Presently Miss Fos-
dick, looking out of the window, saw that the motor</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>on the road far down the valley had not moved.
Someone had dimmed the lights. She thought of
calling Aunt Henrietta‚Äôs attention to it, and then
changed her mind through a desire to spite her by
keeping this bit of excitement a secret.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>Mrs. Weatherby kept thinking of her approach-
ing conversion. It was a subject which had occupied
her a great deal lately; indeed, ever since she had
abandoned the idea of founding a new i-eligion out
of her experience with new faiths. The idea of an
‚Äúeclectic‚Äù faith combining the best points of all reli-
gions had come at length to die for lack of energy
and any sense of organization. She was a muddled
woman and being very rich she had no need of the
material gains which commonly reward contempo-
rary prophets. Indeed, the whole idea had been
rather a failure. She had come to Brinoe to pass
her twilight (‚Äúold age‚Äù was an expression she never
used), expecting something of that triumph and that
notoriety which had come to her in Winnebago Falls
and later at Carmel and Los Angeles; and now it
seemed that she had drawn a blank. No one no-
ticed her, even when she di-ove to the town dressed
all in white carrying tuberoses. There was, she told
herself, too much competition among eccentrics in
BrinoL It was worse, even, than Los Angeles. (At
the moment, as she sat before the blotched mirror,
she experienced an actual jealousy of the posthu-
mous notoriety of Miss Annie Spragg. That queer
old woman had succeeded where she had failed. )</p>
<p>76 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>She wanted notice and flattery and no one in
Brinoe noticed her and no one flattered her save a
little group of Marchesas, Principessas and Con-
tessas, ail old and dowdy and poor who thought
they might get something from her. At first the
mention of their titles pleased her and then she
made the disillusioning discovery that Marchesas
and Contessas were as thick as flies in Italy, and her
natural shrewdness told her that they were simply
leeches. People in Brinoe seemed not to be inter-
ested in Messages and clung stubbornly to conven-
tional forms of religion. Two years of campaign-
ing had brought her nowhere.</p>
<p>Being entirely without sensibility she was never
bored and so could not understand boredom in
others. She did not know into what depths of bore-
dom she had plunged her three visitors that very
afternoon. She never imagined the depths of bore-
dom in which poor Miss Fosdick had spent the bet-
ter part of twenty years, ‚Äî depths so profound that
at times she goaded Mrs. Weatherby into abusing
her simply for the sake of change. It had never
occurred to her, who had known such triumphs in
Carmel and Los Angeles, that in Brinoe she was
regarded simply as a colossal bore from whom peo-
ple fled after one meeting as from a plague. She,
the imposing Henrietta Weatherby I</p>
<p>She had a passion for knowing what she called
‚ÄúInteresting people,‚Äù and Brinoe, she felt, must be
alive with ‚Äúinteresting people‚Äù ‚Äî ^writers, painters,
musicians and others who were simply ‚Äúcharacters.‚Äù
It was simply a matter of meeting them. She firmly
and naively believed that parties made up of people</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>who were ‚Äúdoing things‚Äù instantly became charged
with fascination, wit and brilliant conversation. It
never occurred to her that in groups musicians are
vain and egotistical, painters hostile and technical
and writers envious and mean-spirited. To her they
were all just fascinating.</p>
<p>For months she had given thought to the ques-
tion of how to make herself interesting. Being as
devoid of talents as of sensibility, she could not sud-
denly become a singer, writer or painter, and being
mean by nature she could not bring herself to bay
her way to the things she desired. So in the end
she had fallen back upon her great asset ‚Äî her inter-
est in religion. At last she had hit upon a plan.
She would be converted to the Catholic faith and
become a pillar of devoutness. Perhaps she would
even gain a place for herself in that Papal party re-
ferred to in mysterious whispers by the Marchesa
as the Blacks. Religion, she told herself, was her
sphere. She had spent a lifetime studying religions
and this very fact would give to her conversion a
certain sensational interest. Having been much in
the public prints in America she thought of each
new adventure in headlines. ‚ÄúFamous experimenter
of many faiths turns to bosom of Mother.‚Äù</p>
<p>From the moment she reached a decision she had
set about with energy planning the conversion. The
Marchesa, to whom she expressed a casual interest
in the Roman faith, advised her to be instructed by
Father dAstier as the most fashionable of worldly
missionaries. She let it be known to Miss Fosdick
that a conversion was expected from her at the same
time, but Miss Fosdick, who had followed with</p>
<p>78 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>docility through the mysteries of Christian Science,
of Theosophy, of Bahaism, New Thought and Self
Expression, suddenly rebelled at Rome. Something
in her with roots deep In New England and Congre-
gationalism stubbornly refused to undertake what
she referred to crudely one day as Popery. She was
so firm, so amazingly fanatic on the subject, that
even Mrs. Weatherby was thrown down in defeat.</p>
<p>Sitting before the mirror while Miss Fosdick
brushed her hair Mrs. Weatherby turned over in
her mind the idea of becoming a Papal Countess.
In her imagination she tried over the title, ‚ÄúCount-
ess Weatherby . . . Countess Weatherby.‚Äù It
sounded a little ridiculous. Still she had heard of
other Papal Countesses with names that sounded
more absurd ‚Äî Irish names. If only there was such
a title as ‚ÄúLady.‚Äù ‚ÄúLady Weatherby‚Äù sounded
quite distinguished. And then she frowned as she
thought that such titles were purchased for good
solid money, not bought really, but given in exchange
for rich gifts to the Church. And giving money
was to her like cutting off a piece of her own flesh.</p>
<p>That is probably the reason, she thought, why
Father d‚ÄôAstler came all the way out here in the
heat. He knew that she was rich . . . that and his
curiosity about the miracle of Miss Annie Spragg.</p>
<p>At the thought of Miss Annie Spragg her eyes
narrowed a little. She wished that she knew ex-
actly how the Church meant to treat the miracle.
If the Church canonized Annie Spragg it would
be a great help to her (Mrs. Weatherby). She
could bathe in the glory of having been the only
person in Italy (except Gertrude, who did not</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>count) who knew the queer old woman. She could
indeed pose as the best friend of the saint. That
would advance her a long way, further, indeed,
than any amount of money. Perhaps they mould
make Annie Spragg a saint. They‚Äôd probably
never discover that she was the daughter of old
Cyrus Spragg the Prophet, nor ever hear the scan-
dalous stories that had gone the rounds of Winne-
bago Falls, nor all those things she herself had
chosen not to reveal. Father d‚ÄôAstier had refused
to commit himself. Father d‚ÄôAstier, her shrewd-
ness told her, was a clever man who would need
managing if she were to get from him what she
desired.</p>
<p>She yearned passionately for a confidante witli
whom she might discuss all these things, but with
Gertrude it was impossible. In her stupidity she
would not understand their complications. Un-
doubtedly she Avould put upon them the wrong in-
terpretation.</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>In the placid bosom of Miss Fosdick there was a
fury asmoulder and with each stroke of the brush
it blazed and gained in strength. She had reached
a pitch of boredom and irritation wherein she no
longer asked herself whether she was being disloyal.
All such self-inquiry was being buried under tides
of long-pent-up resentment. It was as if all her soft-
ness had for twenty long years concealed a core
of inflexibility. She was at that moment giving
birth to a character, bringing decision into a soul
where before there had been no decision. And it</p>
<p>8o</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>was such a small thing that kindled this great flame
‚Äî the fact that Mr. Winnery had looked upon her
as if she were a woman. She had not actually seen
him do it. She had /e/rhim looking at her while
Aunt Henrietta was telling that interminable and
inaccurate story of the villa. She was aware that
in the look there was admiration, perhaps even de-
sire. It was years since such a thing had happened
to her. Not since that organist at the Bahai Tem-
ple. &hellip;</p>
<p>Above Mrs. Weatherby‚Äôs grey head she saw her
own reflection in the mirror and she noticed pres-
ently many things that she had forgotten to notice
for a long time past ‚Äî that she had pretty hair,
smooth and shiny and still a mousey brown, that her
eyes were blue and attractive and that her nose was
i-ed and shiny. She thought, ‚ÄúI will buy powder the
next time I go to Brinoe, and I will use It whether
she likes it or not.‚Äù (She had suddenly ceased
thinking of Mrs. Weatherby as Aunt Henrietta but
merely as sheS) Miss Fosdick even wondered If
her hair would be becoming cut short like the Princi-
pessa‚Äôs flaming locks. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she told herself, ‚ÄúI
am too fat. I must try to lose weight. I must write
for one of those diets advertised in the Ladies&rsquo; Own
JV orld.‚Äù Having been born with a fine high color
which needed only toning down, she had no need of
rouge. ‚ÄúStill,‚Äù she thought giddily, ‚Äúa touch on
the lips ‚Äî ^just a touch.‚Äù</p>
<p>Mrs. Weatherby interrupted her. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt pull
so hard. You know how It afiects my nerves.‚Äù</p>
<p>Miss Fosdick had a wild Impulse to say ‚ÄúHumph‚Äù
and, giving the grey hair a good pull, to throw the</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>8i</p>
<p>brush on the floor, but the force of habit ‚ñ†was
stronger than her new-born character and she went
on with her task. When one had done the same
thing at the same hour three hundred and sixty-five
times a year for twenty years the effect became para-
lyzing. She tried to calculate how many times she
had brushed that hateful grey head. Twenty times
three hundred and sixty-five (sometimes three hun-
dred and sixty-six) times one hundred and eighty
strokes. But the problem was quite beyond her.
She was very poor at figures.</p>
<p>A sense of power rose in her with the knowledge
that she had refused flatly to become converted and
that she had taken it quietly. One had one‚Äôs right
to a religion. Nobody could command you to
change your faith, thought Miss Fosdick. People
had been burned for refusing to change, by that
very Church which Aunt Henrietta was considering.
‚ÄúI could never meet my mother in Heaven with her
knowing I had taken up with Popery.‚Äù It was the
first time she had ever refused Aunt Henrietta any-
thing.</p>
<p>Memories of ancient wrongs began to well up in
her soul. Clarence Hazeltine she might have mar-
ried but for Aunt Henrietta, who said she was too
young to marry and carted her off to California.
Clarence ‚Äî she saw him again through mists of
sentiment ‚Äî thin, a little bald at thirty, round-shoul-
dered and round-eyed. Timid he was. If he hadn‚Äôt
been he wouldn‚Äôt have let her be carried off.</p>
<p>Again Mrs. Weatherby interrupted her. ‚ÄúReally,
Gertrude, I don‚Äôt know what has come over you.
You know what a sensitive scalp I have.‚Äù</p>
<p>82 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>Again Miss Fosdick had an impulse to hurl the
brush, this time through the blotched old mirror.
Again habit chained her.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd you needn‚Äôt sulk, either,‚Äù added Mrs.
Weatherby.</p>
<p>Sulk! Sulk! thought Miss Fosdick. It she only
knew what I was thinking. By now Clarence prob-
ably owned the drugstore and had a family that
might have been her own family. And there was
that young organist at Carmel who played in the
Bahai Temple and came to call night after night.
He might have married her but for something she
did. She suspected Aunt Henrietta of telling him
that if he married Gertrude neither of them would
ever get a cent from her. Maybe he did mean to
marry her for Aunt Henrietta‚Äôs money. ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù
Miss Fosdick thought, ‚Äúwhat of it? At least I‚Äôd
have been married- Something would have hap-
pened to me. It would be better than being a fat
old maid. Something has got to happen to me!
Something! Anything! Anything at all!‚Äù</p>
<p>Mrs. Weatherby was speaking again. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm
afraid I have one of my headaches again. Some
enemy is directing ill will toward me.‚Äù</p>
<p>Again Miss Fosdick made no answer. She knew
what the speech meant. In a moment Aunt Hen-
rietta would ask her to sit by the bed all night exert-
ing her will against the currents of malice being pro-
jected at Aunt Henrietta by some unknown enemy.
If she only knew that on those occasions Miss Fos-
dick never stayed awake at all but slept roundly sit-
ting upright. Nothing ever kept Aunt Henrietta
awake when she felt like sleeping.</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>83</p>
<p>‚ÄúOh, I mean to escape,‚Äù Miss Fosdick kept tell-
ing her interiorly, as if to break down the chain of
habit. ‚ÄúOh, I mean to escape, all right.‚Äù She
gazed malignantly at the image of Mrs. Weatherby,
who was doing her nails and practicing her expres-
sion of sweetness at the same time. ‚ÄúAh, if she
only knew.‚Äù But Miss Fosdick hadn‚Äôt the least idea
what she meant to do.</p>
<p>All this time she had been watching the clock and
counting the strokes of the brush with a part of her
mind that seemed immune from that wild torrent
of rebellious thought. One hundred and forty-two,
one hundred and forty-three . . . eight strokes to
the minute according to Mrs. Weatherby‚Äôs schedule.</p>
<p>Aunt Henrietta was speaking again. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm
afraid, dear, that I‚Äôll have to ask you to sit by me
tonight.‚Äù</p>
<p>It was not possible that it was coming so surely,
exactly as she had known it would come. This time
she might have thrown down the brush, but before
she had time to act there rose in the still air the
sound of a voice calling in Italian, ‚ÄúHello ! Hello in
there !‚Äù and the sound of vigorous knocking on the
main door.</p>
<p>For a second the gaze of the two women, so hos-
tile and now suddenly frightened, met in the blotched
old mirror.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWho could it be?‚Äù whispered Mrs. Weatherby,
who was always afraid of something. ‚ÄúAt this hour
of the night?‚Äù</p>
<p>They listened for a moment and then the knock-
ing was repeated and the shouting.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGo to the window, Gertrude.‚Äù</p>
<p>84 the strange CASE OF</p>
<p>Miss Fosdick, with the hateful brush still in her
hand, went timidly to the window on the opposite
side of the room. Below her the graveled court-
yard lay drenched in moonlight and bordered by the
lean black shadows of the cypresses. She was aware
that the motor with dimmed lights still stood on the
opposite side of the valley. At first she could see
no one, and then after a moment a tall man stepped
from the shadow of the portico into the moonlight
and called up to her in Italian. Miss Fosdick under-
stood only the word ‚Äútelephone,‚Äù and partly in ges-
tures, partly in bad Italian, explained that there was
no telephone. The stranger at once began speaking
English in a deep melodious voice with scarcely any
accent.</p>
<p>His companion stepped into the moonlight and
Miss Fosdick recognized him. It was dirty old
Pietro, who kept goats and lived in a hut among the
olive trees half-way up the mountain.</p>
<p>The stranger explained that he was motoring
from Siena to Brinoe and that he had had an acci-
dent. Some thief had charged him for forty litres
of petrol and put only twenty into the tank of his
motor. If they had no telephone he was lost, un-
less by some miracle they had a few litres of petrol.</p>
<p>Behind Miss Fosdick Mrs. Weatherby had
crossed the room and was standing discreetly in the
shadow, peeping from the shelter of a curtain.</p>
<p>There was a miracle and the miracle was the Ford
which Giovanni used for going into Monte Salva-
tore. There must be some petrol in the tank. It
stood in a part of the vast ruined stable built by the
Spanish Ambassador to house his Arab horses.</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>‚ÄúI suppose,‚Äù whispered Mrs. Weatherby, ‚Äúwe
must help him, but I don‚Äôt like people who wander
about in the night.‚Äù She moved to the window and
called down, ‚ÄúYoung man, turn the light on your
face.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúOld Pietro is with him,‚Äù murmured Miss Fos-
dick hopefully.</p>
<p>The stranger did as commanded. He was not a
young man though his figure was trim and slender.
He might have been forty-five. He was distin-
guished and certainly handsome in a dark, almost
Moorish fashion. The humor of the situation had
caused him to grin.</p>
<p>VI</p>
<p>Trembling with excitement, Miss Fosdick, still
carrying the hair-brush absentraindedly in one hand,
took up a candle and clattered down the stone stairs
in her slippers. She was so excited that she even
forgot to be afraid of the garden and made her way
without a tremor through the tunnel that led into
the courtyard. There the stranger met her murmur-
ing a thousand apologies made with all the over-
wrought extravagance of Latin courtesy. He was
dressed in beige tweeds and wore a cap and yellow
buckskin gloves. The wind from Africa had died
away at last and the candle burned in the still air
without a flicker. By its yellow light Miss Fosdick
saw that he was older than she had believed and of
an aspect even more romantic than she had
imagined. Thinking in terms of Aunt Henrietta‚Äôs
speech she told herself that it was Force that he had</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>. . . Personal and Magnetic Force. She thought,
‚ÄúThings are beginning to happen to me. He is ex-
actly like the hero of ‚ÄòIn a Winter City.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<p>Despite herself, her manner became overwrought
and arch. She explained that Mrs. Weatherby was
afraid of Italian servants. . . . She had heard
stories in Carmel . . . and that all the servants
slept in a pavilion near the stables. She led the way
to the stables, followed by the stranger and old Pie-
tro, who limped as he walked and kept muttering
to himself. The miracle at the stables was even
greater than she had hoped. In the shadows and
among the ghosts of the Spanish Ambassador‚Äôs
Arab horses they discovered the battered Ford.
The gasoline tank was full to the brim.</p>
<p>The stranger appeared in such great haste that
he threw himself down without a thought into the
dust and grease beneath the Ford and set to work
filling the two bidons he carried with him. When
he had finished he rose and insisted upon seeing
Miss Fosdick back through the shrubbery despite
all her fluttering protests that she was not afraid.
In the thickest part of the shrubbery he even touched
her arm gently with an old-fashioned courtesy. The
implication that Miss Fosdick was so fragile that
she might easily slip in the darkness and injure her-
self flattered her vanity, and made her feel very
small and feminine. At the door he took out a soft
leather wallet and taking from it a card gave it to
her. It was then that she discovered for the first
time with embarrassment that in one hand she still
held Mrs. Weatherby‚Äôs hair-brush. Strands of
Aunt Henrietta‚Äôs grey hair still clung to it.</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>Bowing, the stranger said, ‚ÄúThis is my name. I
will send a cheque tomorrow. Whose name shall I
put on it?‚Äù</p>
<p>She wanted to say, ‚ÄúOh, no. Don‚Äôt think of it,‚Äù
In a grand and generous manner, but she knew Aunt
Henrietta would Insist upon being paid for the pe-
trol. She should at least have answered, ‚ÄúMrs.
Henrietta Weatherby,‚Äù but In an Insane burst of
unmaidenly behavior, she murmured, ‚ÄúMiss Ger-
trude Fosdick,‚Äù and spelled it for him as he wrote
It down. ‚ÄúF-o-s-d-i-c-k.‚Äù</p>
<p>He took off his cap and bowed elaborately once
more and disappeared, and then for the first time
she was able to look at the card. Being far-sighted
and not having her glasses, she had to hold it far
from her. She read,</p>
<p>Oreste Valmente
El Duque de Fuenterrabia
El Marques de Santoban</p>
<p>For a moment she feared her knees would give
way. It was just like a novel, she thought. Just
like a novel. It was like one of those stories of
Ouida, one of the things you got in a paper-backed
edition. Just like ‚ÄúIn a Winter City.‚Äù The hand
trembled with excitement and the flame of the can-
dle trembled too. Her shadow trembled on the an-
cient wall so that it looked as If she were dancing.
Presently she shut the door and shot the huge Iron
bolt, but as she closed It she caught a sudden
glimpse of the statue gleaming white in the moon-
light and felt suddenly frightened again.</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>A voice from the top of the stairs brought her
back to the horrid reality.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat on earth are you doing, Gertrude ? They
have gone long ago.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then Miss Fosdick remembered that there were
still thirty-seven strokes of the brush to be done.</p>
<p>VII</p>
<p>When she re-entered the bedroom, Aunt Hen-
rietta was awaiting her in a cold fury. She exhibited
all the signs of what Miss Fosdick described to her-
self as ‚Äúa tantrum.‚Äù She had been working toward
this point ever since dinner-time. Miss Fosdick
knew the signs ‚Äî the look of fury in the eye, the dis-
tended nostrils of the large, fleshy nose, the fat
hands clasping the foot of the bed, the heavy breath-
ing. With her thin grey hair hanging about her
face, she was a terrifying sight that caused all the
flame of rebellion burning in Miss Fosdick‚Äô s bosom
to turn to water and flow away.</p>
<p>For a moment Mrs. Weatherby stood regarding
her in a cold silence as if choosing how she should
begin. Then suddenly she found what was needed.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat on earth have you got in your hair ?‚Äù she
cried out. ‚ÄúI think you must be crazy lately . . .
an old maid like you putting flowers in her hair, as
if a man was going to look at you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something exploded In Miss Fosdick‚Äôs brain.
She hurled the brush and the candle on the floor.
The card of Oreste Valmente, Duke of Fonterrabia
and Marquis of Santoban, fell with them.</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 89</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôll put what I like in my hair and you can go to
Hell.‚Äù</p>
<p>For a moment Mrs. Weatherby recoiled as if
Miss Fosdick had struck her a blow. ‚ÄúOh! Oh!‚Äù
she cried in a stricken manner, and then firmly,
‚ÄúTake care what you‚Äôre saying.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôll put what I like in my hair. I‚Äôm an old maid
because you made me one.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a ridiculous sight.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo more than you and your silly religions.
You‚Äôve spoiled everything for me.‚Äù</p>
<p>Mrs. Weatherby gave a throaty laugh. ‚ÄúSpoiled
everything, have I ? And where would you be with-
out me, pray? You‚Äôd have nothing except for me.
You‚Äôd be a pauper.‚Äù</p>
<p>In Miss Fosdick a hundred respectable New Eng-
land ancestors rose and ran riot. ‚ÄúYou. Every-
body laughs at you. Nobody ever comes here but
a lot of old women who want a meal.‚Äù She choked
and began to cry hysterically. ‚ÄúAnd a lot of old
fools with silly religions.‚Äù</p>
<p>Suddenly with a groan Mrs. Weatherby collapsed
full length on the floor. She lay there crying out,
calling upon Heaven to witness the ingratitude of
this creature she had protected for so long. Miss
Fosdick understood only fragments. ‚ÄúAfter I‚Äôm
dead you‚Äôll remember. . . . After all I‚Äôve done for
you.‚Äù</p>
<p>But Miss Fosdick felt suddenly seasick and ran
from the room. The screams followed her along
the corridor until she was in her own room with the
door bolted behind her.</p>
<p>Sobbing, she seated herself at the dressing-table.</p>
<p>90 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>There was a light in her eye. At last the suppressed
hatred of twenty years was satisfied. She had told
Aunt Henrietta what she thought of her. The feel-
ing was like a fresh cool breeze. It was all over.
She was free . . . free with one hundred and
thirty-two lira in the world, the savings of twenty
years of slavery. Free, and there was nothing she
could do, not even sew properly. But she was free.
She could scrub floors. She was free.</p>
<p>In all the confusion the sprig of jasmine had
come loose from her hair and had fallen into the V
that revealed her plump white throat. She took it
out and laid it on the table. Then when she had
grown more calm, she regarded herself in the an-
cient mirror and fell to trying new ways of doing her
hair. She couldn‚Äôt go out into the world dressed in
the ridiculous fashion that she had always com-
manded. Her hands trembled. She was afraid of
herself and of this madness which had swept her
without any effort of will into revolt. This was a
strange woman who looked out of the mirror at
her. Who was she? This creature bom of the
fires of hatred.</p>
<p>Then she let her hair fall down. It reached to
her waist. Her hair, she told herself, had always
been her great beauty even as a girl. She could not
cut it</p>
<p>Presently she rose feeling weak and shaken, and
after drinking half a bottle of Fiuzzi water, went
to the window for air. Far down below in the val-
ley she could see a tiny light moving through the
olive trees toward the stalled motor. Presently it
reached the road, the lights of the motor flared up.</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>There was a sudden wild impatient roar and the
car shot away toward Brinoe. As the lights dis-
appeared around a curve of the valley, she suddenly
felt seasick once more. The romance was gone and
with it all the intoxication of her wild hysterical out-
burst. She was an old maid with one hundred and
thirty-two lira in the world. She had not even a
friend and there was no work that she could do.
The fascinating Duque de Fuenterrabia wbuld never
even think of her again. She was quite certain now.
The twenty years had driven her insane at last.</p>
<p>VIII</p>
<p>For an hour Mrs. Weatherby lay on the floor
waiting for Miss Fosdick to return and beg forgive-
ness. When at last the floor had grown impossibly
hard and there seemed to be little chance of her
companion coming back, she raised herself, and
picked up the brush and the candle. Then for the
first time she saw the card of Oreste Valmente,
Duque de Fuenterrabia and Marques de Santoban.
Twice she read it through with awe and then thrust
it reverently into the side of the blotchy mirror.
Doing her thin hair into a knot, she walked down
the corridor to Miss Fosdick‚Äôs room, where a line
of light showed beneath the door. For a moment
she stood thoughtfully and then, knocking gently,
she called out in the voice of a dove, ‚ÄúGertrude.
Gertrude dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no answer and she called again, ‚ÄúGer-
trude. Gertrude.‚Äù</p>
<p>Again only silence.</p>
<p>92 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>‚ÄúGertrude dear. Listen to Aunt Henrietta.
YouVe broken her heart.‚Äù</p>
<p>Still no response.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGertrude dear. Aunt Henrietta is willing to
forgive. You wouldn‚Äôt let a little quarrel like that
break up all the love of twenty years ?‚Äù</p>
<p>Not a word.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGertrude let Aunt Henrietta go to bed</p>
<p>knowing that you are sorry for the awful things you
said.‚Äù</p>
<p>In the end she went away, and in the morning
when she went again to Miss Fosdick‚Äôs room, she
found it empty. Margharita, with a malicious
gleam in her eye, said she had seen Miss Fosdick at
dawn walking along the road to Monte Salvatore.
She was carrying a handbag.</p>
<p>A PRAIRIE IDYLL</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>TN THE seventies the town of Cordova straggled</p>
<p>its length along the highroad which once had
been a trail across the prairies into the Far West.
There were a few houses built of sawed timber, a
few of the log houses that were remnants of its
early days, a few shanties that served as dwelling-
places for the negroes along the river, and the pre-
tentious brick buildings of the Primitive Methodist
Divinity School. The village sat pressed against a
flat prairie so vast that It seemed to extend to the
limits of the known world. The only break in the
even line of its monotony was the sluggish meander-</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>ing river whose waters were red with the fertility
of the earth. To the south there extended a great
area of land that had once been only a vast marsh,
but with the passing of centuries the slow-moving
river had cut itself deeper and deeper into the soil,
draining the marsh and leaving it dry with a caked
peat-like surface which burned slowly with the
flameless Intensity of rotten wood. In the seventies
there was so much rich land to be had that no one
paused on his way west to claim any of the bog,
and when the peat-like surface took fire it was al-
lowed to bum until drowned by the flood-like rains
of the spring. Always there was some part of the
bog asmoulder, sending up great columns of white
smoke. The sight provided variety in a landscape
that otherwise was Insanely monotonous. Some-
times the soil burned in a dozen places at once so
that the whole countryside to the south of Cor-
dova took on the aspect of Hell, and sometimes
In the fantastic damp heat of the prairie summers
there, appeared In it the mirages of lakes that
seemed made of smouldering brimstone. The water
In wells of that flat country was stale and fiat and
without life.</p>
<p>It was to this town that Uriah Spragg and his
sister Annie came on the death of their mother, for
Uriah had set his mind on becoming a preacher of
the Primitive Methodist faith and to thus atone for
the colossal sins of his father, the Prophet. And
Uriah Spragg was no longer a young man and he
knew now that there was much to atone for. He
planned after he was ordained to go from place to
place In a wagon as his father had done, preaching</p>
<p>94 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>in villages and crossroads, wiping out the evil spread
by the Prophet.</p>
<p>The burden of his father‚Äôs sin was a thing which
never left him.</p>
<p>He was a tall man, raw-boned in the parlance of
the country, with great wrists and knuckles and knee-
bones. Save for his great strength ‚Äî he could
straighten horseshoes and bend bars of iron ‚Äî ^lie
had nothing in common with the Prophet. It was
as if Nature had taken an impish delight in making
father and son so unlike each other. Uriah‚Äôs hair
was sandy red and sparse; Uriah‚Äôs lips were thin
and always drawn a little, as if there was some pain
forever gnawing him from within. His skin was
pale and di*y and covered with freckles; and his
beard, which he shaved, was thin and scraggly. In
his face there were deep furrows that seemed cut
there by a careless chisel. His pale blue eyes had a
way of wavering and shifting restlessly, so that they
appeared never to be looking directly into the eyes
of any person. It may have been the sense of his
father‚Äôs sin, the shame of being a son of the Pro-
phet, which made him fearful and uneasy, for he
was a sensitive man who suffered agonies. It was
the soul of a woman in the body of a giant. And he
was shy and silent and had no friends, for he be-
lieved that people were forever whispering about
the doings of his father.</p>
<p>He came to Cordova to learn what he must learn,
a man already on his way to middle age, to listen to
sermons and read the teachings of Wesley with
adolescent boys come out of the prairies and corn-
fields, all like himself believing themselves chosen</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 95</p>
<p>by God to spread His word. There were boys
among them scarcely more than half his age and
none of them was as old as his youngest sister Annie.</p>
<p>There was between Annie and Uriah a mysteri-
ous feeling which bound them together, as if they
had been twins born of the same cell rather than
brother and sister separated by twelve years with
many brothers and sisters between. It may have
been the knowledge that they were the two most
cherished by the tired long-suffering woman who
had borne them, or that they alone of all the thir-
teen understood the long agony of her lifetime.
And they had known now for a long time, without
once speaking of it, that their father was neither
God nor God‚Äôs Prophet nor even a good man, but
only a lustful old reprobate who deceived himself
into believing that he was God. It was a thought
neither of them had ever uttered. They knew it.
And when their mother died they went quickly away
because Uriah was in haste to begin the atonement.</p>
<p>It had never occurred to either of them that on
leaving the Saint‚Äôs colony they should go separate
ways. Having lived always a little apart from the
world in the strange migratory life of the Prophet,
having been steeped always in religion and Bible
reading, they came to believe without knowing it
that they were strange marked creatures who did
not belong to the world as others did. As far back
as they could remember the world had treated them
as curiosities. There were always crowds about
the wagon of the Prophet staring at him and his
children &hellip; as if they were wild beasts.</p>
<p>g6</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>At the time they came to Cordova Annie Spragg
was possessed of a strange wild beauty that passed
for plainness among the women of the place because
it had none of the chromo-like prettiness for which
their starved souls had a craving! More discern-
ing and worldly critics would have discovered in her
figure and in her sly face a mysterious excitement
that stirred what was deepest and most carnal in
man. Of all the thirteen legitimate children of the
Prophet she alone appeared to have been touched
by the same unholy power which he came to under-
stand so well and to exploit with such profit. The
two eldest sons had it not, for their joint imposture
of the Prophet had been discovered soon enough by
the women of the Saint‚Äôs colony. They were not
men enough to fill their father‚Äôs shoes.</p>
<p>She was of middle height with red hair, not the
nondescript sandy red of Uriah‚Äôs hair, but a deep
flaming red as her mother‚Äôs hair had been on the
day the Prophet first saw her in her father‚Äôs cabin
at St. Louis before she had borne thirteen children
in fifteen years; and her skin was not pale and
freckled like Uriah‚Äôs, but of that waxen green-white
to be found in the women of Titian. Her figure at
twenty-four was slim, but possessed of curves which
even stiff skirts and coarse black cloth could not
conceal. Her eyes were greenish and of an odd
almond shape, slanting upward at the outer corners ;
and her mouth was the mouth of the Prophet him-
self, red and full-blooded and voluptuous, with a dis-
turbing power of excitement. She had a gliding.</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>97</p>
<p>sinuous walk. Yet because love had not touched her,
she went her way all unconscious of her power.
Like Uriah, the dark unspoken things which they
knew but never mentioned had made her afraid even
of herself. Elsewhere, outside the lost village, she
could have had what she wanted from the world,
but in Cordova desire and the flesh were things to
inspire horror. And always like a warning against
the pale sky of that flat country rose the clouds of
smoke from the burning bog, always the mirage of
lakes of burning brimstone.</p>
<p>They rented one of the decaying log cabins from
an old pioneer woman who had gone to live with
her grandchildren, and when Uriah had stopped the
holes in the roof and the walls they settled them-
selves in it until Uriah should be ordained. Though
it was a thing never spoken of between them, they
understood that neither of them should ever marry.
Uriah had no desire to marry. Women had made
his mother‚Äôs life a long and passionate tragedy. She
alone of all the women in the world was pure and
good. He was afraid of women and hated them.
There were even times when he hated his sister
Annie for being a woman and the root of sin. He
hated her for her fine shining hair and red lips, and
for her sinuous walk.</p>
<p>Ill</p>
<p>Among all those who came to the seminary at
Cordova believing they were the elect of God, there
was a youth named Leander Potts, one of the nine
sons of a farmer on the plains west of the Missis-</p>
<p>98 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>sippi. He had come in a way as an offering to God
from a father who was grateful for nine sons, but
he would have come whether his father permitted
it or not because he had seen visions while turning
the sod and knew that God had chosen him. And
his mother was a religious, who was half insane from
the loneliness of a prairie where there were no other
women. Leander was her darling and the one
chosen by her to follow God. To him had been
given the richest food. He alone had been given
books and the time to read them. When he came
to Cordova he was still an adolescent, chaste and
tempted, troubled by visions and dreams, carnal and
celestial. He was, too, a strong youth.</p>
<p>He was handsome in the florid way of Anglo-
Saxon youths, with curling blond hair and bright
blue eyes with long dark lashes like those of a girl.
At forty he would be ruddy and perhaps bloated.
At twenty he was like a young Florentine painted
by Leonardo.</p>
<p>It was Leander Potts who became the only friend
of Annie and Uriah Spragg. It was a slow thing,
this friendship, for Uriah with his pride and sense
of difference from the rest of the world, could make
no advances. And Annie stayed much at home, save
for solitary walks along the sluggish river when she
was happy, noticing the ways of the birds and beasts,
the trees and the flowers. Uriah acknowledged the
greetings of his fellow students, but chose never to
be the first to exchange a word regarding the
weather or the sermons. He had the sensitiveness
of a boy too old and too big for his schoolfellows.</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>99</p>
<p>He was all joints and knuckles, ashamed and flush-
&rsquo; ing easily.</p>
<p>But from the first day when he saw Leander‚Äôs
curly yellow head before him in the chapel, he felt
j drawn toward the boy. The sight of Leander was</p>
<dl>
<dt>i like a ray of sunlight piercing the gloomy depths of</dt>
<dd>
<p>his soul, illuminating and warming it as no man or</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>‚Äô woman save his mother had ever been able to do.</p>
<p>; And Leander was, too, a sort of an ideal, a symbol</p>
<p>I of all that which Uriah might have been save for</p>
<p>i his age, his uncouthness and the scar upon his soul.</p>
<p>I Leander seemed in truth the chosen of God ‚Äî</p>
<p>i comely, confident, young and, in a community made</p>
<p>1 harsh by fear of a terrible God, a creature bright</p>
<p>I with charm. On the day he first spoke to Uriah,</p>
<p>I the older man felt the skies open and saw the sun</p>
<p>I pour through.</p>
<p>I In Leander the first impulse to speak arose from</p>
<p>i a sense of pity for Uriah, who even in that queer</p>
<p>^ community seemed strange and awkward and out</p>
<p>of place. It was Uriah‚Äôs loneliness that touched
; him, almost without his knowing it.</p>
<p>) From that moment onward the older man came</p>
<p>to look for the boy‚Äôs greeting as one who lives in a
dour climate looks for the sun. He plotted, with-
^ out plotting, that he might encounter Leander dur-</p>
<p>I ing the day. To Annie, waiting for him at home, he</p>
<p>f seemed to grow more cheerful and talkative. She</p>
<p>j wondered at the reason, but she never asked him</p>
<p>&rsquo; and Uriah could not have told her why the world</p>
<p>seemed a better place, less black with sin.</p>
<p>As for Annie, she cooked and baked, and^in order
i to help Uriah with money she</p>

<p>100</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>for the women of the village. She even made an
entrance into that trade which all small towns as-
sociate with fast women. She became a milliner.
But the people of Cordova did not take kindly to
her. Her silence and aloofness disturbed them.
They came to know presently that she was the
daughter of the Prophet Spragg and so they gave
her a name for immorality and evil, a reputation
which her appearance, despite all her plain and ugly
clothes, could not deny. No matter how black her
dresses, there was something in the green slanting
eyes, the pointed nose, the red hair and the white
sicin which made women draw together in little
groups like hens as she passed and caused men to
look after her as if their wills had turned to butter.
The wall of her isolation grew higher and higher,
shutting her in from all the world. And so she took
to going more and more on those solitary walks
along the river-bank. The river was the only re-
lief from the monotony of that smoke-hazed world.</p>
<p>Because human companionship was denied her
she came to make friends of the birds and the tiny
beasts, the flowers and the rare trees of that flat
country. The very rabbits came to know her and
the birds along the river-bank awaited her coming
with the crumbs she brought from her table. It
was a happy life and she seemed content with it,
living only in dread of the coming of winter. Some-
times when she had gone a long way and could see
across the flat land that there was no one within
miles of her, she would take off her ugly black dress
and tight stays and bathe in a warm sluggish
stream, warming her naked body sinfully in the sun-</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG loi</p>
<p>light. And all the while she drifted further and
further from the dreadful God of Cordova. Uriah
noticed it and reproved her. He saw her sit dream-
ing in the House of God, deaf to the harsh words
of the Reverend Mr. Simpson, her mind wandering
far from ‚Äúa Hell paved with the skulls of unbap-
tized infants.‚Äù And his fear for her would be
shadowed at times with a strange dark cloud of
hatred and envy, as if he understood somehow that
she was secretly escaping him and the sins of their
father and the justice of a vengeful God.</p>
<p>His friendship with Leander grew, bringing with
it a disturbing and incomplete happiness. As the
older of the two he gave Leander timid advice. To-
gether they had long talks of the future, rising into
a flame of passion at the glory of spreading abroad
the Kingdom of God as taught in Cordova. They
went on long rambles across a country where each
mile was exactly like the last and the one before and
talk could be the only diversion. Uriah always
walked bent forward a little, his great bony hands
clasped behind his back. And one day Uriah in a
burst of fire proposed timidly that when they left
Cordova they should set out together in a covered
wagon carrying their message to remote villages
and crossroads where men of God seldom came.
Annie, his sister, said Uriah, could go with them
and cook and mend their clothes. Life seemed to
become a bright and beautiful thing.</p>
<p>Leander said, ‚ÄúBut your sister. I have never
seen your sister. I will go home with you tonight
and see her.‚Äù</p>
<p>But Uriah‚Äôs face grew dark and he was silent,</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>torn between a desire to take the beloved Leander
to his home and an obscure and nameless fear of
having Leander lay eyes upon his sister Annie.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>Leander did come to the house, not that day but
another, one evening just after the long prairie sun-
set. Uriah was not there and Annie asked him in
to await her brother‚Äôs coming. The meeting dis-
turbed them both, but in Leander‚Äôs feelings there
was no pity for Annie as there had been for Uriah.
He was confused and frightened. For a long time
now he had been aware of women, but he had never
been aware of one woman, and there was something
about this strange girl which seemed to be the
apotheosis of all women. He watched her, afraid
but fascinated, while she went quietly about her work
in the kitchen, making polite and halting remarks
about the weather or the com or the sermon of the
Reverend Mr. Simpson. It was all outwardly cold
and meaningless and inwardly charged with disturb-
ing things. Leander was aware of her in every
nerve and muscle. Annie, watching him stealthily,
was aw‚Äôare of a new beauty come into her life. Of
late during the long walks by the river life had
seemed to be opening like a flower, petal by petal,
in a loveliness she had never suspected. And now
came this beautiful young man with blue eyes and
fair curling hair like an angel.</p>
<p>Uriah came at last, dark-browed and forbidding,
and when Annie suggested that his friend stay to</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>supper, he could not send Leander away. Leander
did stay and all through supper Annie sat modestly
with eyes cast down while her brother and his
friend talked of the church and of God.</p>
<p>After that Leander came more and more often,
though there was little talk between him and Annie.
Evening after evening she sat quietly apart in the
darkness by the fireplace while the two men read the
Scriptures and interpreted them. Sometimes she
sat watching Leander‚Äôs golden head from under her
long lashes without being seen and sometimes when
he was reading she stole sudden quick glances at his
odd disturbing beauty. Always Uriah took care
that the atmosphere should be saturated with the
words of the Bible. He fought his battle in silence,
filled with a corroding jealousy, knowing always that
Leander was there because of Annie and not because
of himself or of God. Craftily he chose to read
and expound passages filled with sonorous warnings
against unchastity, of the evils of the flesh and of
desire. He read always In the cold tight voice of
one in pain.</p>
<p>And presently Leander came to look ill. The
high color left his cheeks and there was a tired look
in his blue eyes. At night his visions and dreams
grew more and more fantastic and troubled, filled
with strange beasts like those out of the Apocalypse.
Annie gave him pennyroyal tea to drink lest he be
coming down with the fevers that swept the hot,
damp prairies, and as he drank she watched him
closely out of the green, veiled, slanting eyes.
Leander knew now when she was watching him. It</p>
<p>104 the strange case OF</p>
<p>was as if her gaze burned into his flesh and set his
blood on fire. Slowly Uriah grew confident again,
believing that he had won and kept the soul of
Leander unstained by the sin of desire that had
damned his own father. Annie said nothing, for
they never spoke of such things.</p>
<p>Six months after Leander first came to the cabin,
a tenth child was born in the house where he lodged
and there was no longer room for him. Nor was
there any room in all the village save in the house of
Annie and Uriah Spragg. He came there with his
carpet-bag and tin trunk to live in the extra room,
and after that there was no longer any peace in the
house, but only smothered passion and hatred and
jealousy. Uriah, more terrified than before, talked
much and hysterically of their mission, saying that
they must give themselves in chastity to God alone,
looking neither to right nor to left. Leander de-
voured himself with desire and a sense of sin.</p>
<p>One night in midsummer when the heat and still-
ness of the country was intolerable, the three of
them sat as usual in the single common room. It
was Leander‚Äôs turn to read the Scripture and he
chose to read from the Song of Songs which is Solo-
mon‚Äôs, showing the Mutual Love of Christ and his
Church. He plunged deep into the middle of it as
if he had been reading it again and again and knew
each verse, and he read in a loud and terrible voice
shaken with his inward illness. Crying out, he read.</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>105</p>
<p>‚ÄúHow beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O Prin-
cess: the joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the
work of the hands of a cunning workman.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth
not liquor: thy belly is like a heap of wheat set
about with lilies.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThy two breasts are like two young roes that are
twins.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like
the fish pools of Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-
rabbim : thy nose is as the. tower of Lebanon which
looketh toward Damascus.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the
hair of thine head like purple ; the king is held in the
galleries.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHow fair and how pleasant art thou, O Love,
for delights.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy
breasts to clusters of grapes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take
hold of the boughs thereof; now also thy breasts
shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy
nose like apples.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for
my beloved, that goeth down sweetly, causing the
lips of those that are asleep to speak.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am my beloved‚Äôs, and his desire is toward me.‚Äù</p>
<p>In her corner Annie Spragg stopped seeing.
She clasped her hands together lest their trembling
betray her. Uriah Spragg sat upright and very
still, his bony hands hanging at his side, his fur-
rowed face ashen and drawn and strangely like the</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>io6</p>
<p>head of death. He looked neither to one side nor
the other. It was as if he did not hear the pas-
sionate voice of Leander, torn and twisted by the
dark things in his soul.</p>
<p>And Annie Spragg knew now, for the words of
Solomon had made her aware of her body.</p>
<p>When Leander had finished and put down the
book, Uriah without a word reached out a knotty
hand and took it from him. In silence he turned
the pages and then in the cold strangled voice that
was so different from the warm, rich voice of the
Prophet, he read,</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have heard it said of them of old time. Thou
shalt not commit adultery.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut I say unto you, that whosoever looketh upon
a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery
with her already in his heart.‚Äù</p>
<p>When he had finished, he closed the book with-
out a word and, rising, went into his own room, leav-
ing them alone. Leander rose and in silence rushed
through the open door out into the cornfields. And
Annie, sitting alone in her corner, heard the voice of
her brother raised in prayer.</p>
<p>VI</p>
<p>All the next morning the three in the cabin went
the mean small round of their existence betraying
no sign of recognizing the thing that had happened.
Life went on the same as if by denying the thing
they could annihilate its existence. But at noonday</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>107</p>
<p>neither Leander nor Uriah came home for dinner.
Annie waited for them and when at last she gave
up all hope of their coming, she locked the house
and set out for a walk along the river.</p>
<p>It was a hot still afternoon, damp with the, smell
of growing corn turning to milk in the ear, and she
walked slowly, stopping now and then to rest in the
shade of the feathery willows and witch-hazel that
grew in the fertile soil by the edge of the stream.
Two little birds followed her, twittering and flying
from bush to bush. Once while she was resting
three quail came out from among the rows of corn
to eat the crusts she brought them. The mud
turtles, instead of slipping in alarm from logs and
stones into the water, watched her with staring
beady eyes, unafraid. The bluejays out of vulgar
friendliness kept up a wild screeching and calling.</p>
<p>She wandered on and on, sadly and in a kind of
dream, not knowing why it was she felt so tired and
so confused, knowing only that the heat and the
smell of the coim seemed to fill her with an over-
powering desire to sleep. She had w^alked for miles
and miles when she came at last to a spot which
long ago she had chosen for her own. It lay in a
wide bend of the meandering stream so that the
fragment of earth was almost an island. In an-
other year the spring floods would have cut through
the narrow neck and isolated it, leaving it to be
washed away bit by bit in the years that followed,
into the distant ocean that Annie had never seen.
No one had ploughed this land and it lay overgrown
with a thicket of golden-rod and sumach and gen-
tians. Here she had come alone many times. There</p>
<p>io8 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>was a kind of bower where she lay whole after-
noons watching the ways of the birds and the
beetles, the turtles and the ants. Sometimes she fell
asleep, to awake only when the afternoon sun had
fallen low on the prairie and the cool of evening
had begun.</p>
<p>Today she pushed her way through the briars
into the bower and flinging herself down yielded to
the hunger for sleep.</p>
<p>vn</p>
<p>It was late when she awakened slowly, aware of
a faint pleasant sound of splashing somewhere near
her, a sound that was cool, as if the water touched
her own hot troubled brow. Slowly she sat up and
looking out from the bower, she saw the cause of
the noise. On the log in the midst of the stream
sat Leander with his back to her, quite naked. He
was splashing his feet in the water and sending it
high in the air to fall down in glistening drops over
his blond head and white body.</p>
<p>A strange, voluptuous weakness filled her body
so that she could not rise. She felt that she must
be dying. She knew that if she did rise she could
not escape lest he notice her and know that she had
seen him thus. She was frozen to the earth, fas-
cinated and helpless, and suddenly Leander slipped
into the reddish water and swam away toward the
far shore. She tried to cover her face with her
hands, but she could not move them to her face.
On the sloping bank opposite Leander was lifting
a great stone high above his head. She saw the</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>109</p>
<p>muscles flow beneath the white skin as he lifted it
higher and higher until with a gesture of triumph in
his own strength he hurled it from him into the
midst of the cornfield. Then he ran and leaped and
turned cartwheels on the thick red-black soil, and
Annie, burying her face in the thick grass to shield
it from what she kept seeing, felt a sudden wave of
sickening beauty, of a kind she had never known
before. It was a new world, as unknown to her as
it was to the people of Cordova. Beauty and de-
light in life flowed in upon her, dazzling and blind-
ing her, and with a great sense of freshness and
freedom, as if she were herself for the first time,
she pressed her face against the earth and wept.</p>
<p>When she raised her head again he was gone, and
pulling herself to her feet she pushed her way
through the bushes and ran along the edge of the
high corn, keeping close against the willows and
sumach for fear that he might see her and know that
she had seen him in his nakedness. When she had
run a long way, she fell from exhaustion and lay
panting.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFrom this day,‚Äù she thought, ‚ÄúI am a lost
woman.‚Äù For she knew now that she was sick with
desire for Leander.</p>
<p>In the south the bog was afire and the white
smoke drifted slowly up in a great cloud against the
prairie sky. In it the lakes of brimstone swam and
flickered in the heat.</p>
<p>no</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>VIII</p>
<p>She found Uriah waiting for her, his narrow eyes
dark with suspicion and accusation, but neither of
them said anything. They waited for Leander to
return and at last at dark when he had not come in
they sat down to eat without speaking to each other.
It was nine o‚Äôclock and Uriah had been many times
to the door looking out into the darkness when at
last Leander appeared. He was hatless and in his
hand he carried Annie Spragg‚Äôs sunbonnet. Look-
ing at her with a queer expression in his blue eyes,
he said, ‚ÄúI found it by the bend in the river. I
knew it was yours.‚Äù</p>
<p>It was a strange accusing look as if he believed
that she had been spying on him. Behind it lay a
mist of shocked and confusing thoughts. She took
the bonnet and ran into her room, closing the door
and bolting it.</p>
<p>But she did not sleep. It was as if a demon had
taken possession of her. She heard Uriah and
Leander talking, talking, talking, still as if nothing
unusual had occurred. She heard them reading the
Scripture, Uriah in his tight pinched voice, Leander
in his low warm soft one. She heard one of them
go to bed and then the other. The light disappeared
and all the house fell into darkness. She lay think-
ing, ‚ÄúI am an evil woman. I am cursed as my father
was before me. I had better die. I had better kill
myself at once.‚Äù</p>
<p>Her love for Leander was so great that she could
no longer breathe in peace. And he had said noth-
ing. Perhaps tomorrow he would go away and she</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG iii</p>
<p>would never see him again. They could not go on
like this. Perhaps if she did not kill herself, Uriah
would kill her. She had thought of late that there
was a look of cold murder in his eye. They could
not go on like this.</p>
<p>She did not know how long she lay thus torment-
ing herself, but toward morning she rose, thinking
to go into the kitchen for a drink of water from the
pail that stood there. It was not clear sparkling
water, but the dead stale water of the flat country.
In the darkness she made her way through the com-
mon room into the kitchen. She found the pail.
She was raising the dipper to her hot parched lips
when there was a sound of a door opening. She
pressed against the wall listening and presently
someone crossed the common room and entered
the kitchen. She thought, ‚ÄúIt may be Uriah coming
to kill me.‚Äù And then with a sudden sick feeling,
‚ÄúIt may be Leander. He, too, could not sleep.‚Äù
But in the blackness she could not make certain.</p>
<p>She heard the figure in the dark fumbling at the
latch of the kitchen door. The door opened against
the blue of the prairie night and she saw that it was
Leander. He was dressed and in his hand he car-
ried his carpet-bag. He was going away and she
would never see him again. She grew cold and
trembled and wanted to cry out, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go,
Leander. Don‚Äôt go. I am here waiting for you.
Nothing makes any difference.‚Äù He must not go
away. He must not go away.</p>
<p>And then, although she had not cried out, he
hesitated for a moment as if he had felt her stand-
ing there in the darkness, and putting down the bag</p>
<p>II2</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>he turned and made his way toward the water pail.
He was coming nearer and nearer. He was beside
her now, he would see her in a moment. In a low
voice, she said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me, Annie. Leander, you
mustn‚Äôt go away.‚Äù</p>
<p>She heard him make a sudden quick movement
of terror and echo, ‚ÄúAnnie,‚Äù and then it seemed to
her that they were enveloped by a flame.</p>
<p>IX</p>
<p>In the morning he was gone and he did not re-
turn all that day though she went a hundred times
to the door of the cabin to look for him. And he
did not return the next day or the next. On the
fourth day they found him. It was Uriah who
made the discovery. Leander was lying at the bend
in the river a little way from Annie‚Äôs bower. He was
dead and his gun lay beside him. He had shot him-
self through the head.</p>
<p>It %vas Uriah who brought her the news. He
told the story simply, as if he did not know the
reason why Leander had destroyed himself or that
It meant anything at all to her. There was only the
look in the pale blue eyes, so cold, so full of hatred
that Annie Spragg turned away and hid her face
Uriah Spragg had now to atone for the sin of his
sister as well as the sin of his father. They never
spoke of It again, for it was their habit never to
speak of sms but only of sin. And they never spoke
again of Leander. ^</p>
<p>But they had to leave Cordova before Uriah was
ordained because people began to whisper that they</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>‚Äù3</p>
<p>were evil because they were children of the Prophet,
and that Annie was a witch and a bad woman. They
even whispered that between them the brother and
sister had made way with Leander because of the
things he knew. One morning Annie found under
the door a crude, misspelled letter warning them
that if they did not leave the town before nightfall
they would be tarred and feathered and driven out.
They left and took up a life of wandering, for there
was no place in all the world where they belonged.</p>
<p>A SENTIMENTAL PASSAGE</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>W HEN Anna d‚ÄôOrobelli left Father d‚ÄôAstier
before the door of the tall house where he
stayed when in Brinoe, their parting was a simple
good-night. There was not even a pressure of the
hand, for a curious and unfamiliar restraint had
taken possession of them both. All the way from
the Villa Leonardo, they had driven side by side in
silence while the big motor roared up hill and down
through the yellow dust. At the door she did not
even wait for him to mount the steps and disappear,
but turned the car and rushed away across the
Piazza. She was late already and at forty-nine a
woman could ill afford to keep a lover waiting. But
she was driven, too, by a fierce desire to escape the
quiet eyes of Father d‚ÄôAstier. He had, she thought,
come at last to make a truce with life, and so he
was calm and filled with peace. He had rest and
that was a precious thing.</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>1 14</p>
<p>She fled from him as she might have tried to flee
her own conscience. Father d‚ÄôAstier ‚Äòlaas all the
conscience she had, and now he had turned up in
Brinoe when she wanted least to encounter him.
Who could have expected to find him there in the
horrible heat of August when everybody fled Brinoe?
(In her mind echoed the shadow, ‚ÄúAnybody who
is anybody.‚Äù Not seedy people, of course, like
those she had encountered this afternoon. ) Oh, he
knew well enough why she was there and what she
was doing. That was why he had been so silent, as
if she were betraying him. But he had been reason-
able enough, all things considered; he had never re-
proached her but once and then only by the inscrip-
tion on the fly-leaf of the Thomas-a-Kempis. He
had kept silent, which in a way was worse than if
he had spoken, especially when you had loved him
for nearly thirty years.</p>
<p>At the door of the Palazzo Biancamano, she
turned the motor over to the chauffeur. ‚ÄúAt five
tomorrow, Enrico,‚Äù she said, looking a little away
from him. Enrico, too, knew why she was in
Brinoe. He knew why she had driven through the
dust and heat all the way from Venice in August.
She would not need the motor until five because she
and Oreste would spend the heat of the day in the
apartment.</p>
<p>As the motor drove off she turned and looked up
at the windows of the apartment with that sudden
feeling of sickness and ecstasy which always over-
came her at such times. The windows were still
dark. She was in time. He had not come yet.</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>1 15</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>It was not her own apartment. She hated Brinoe
because she thought the people who lived there dull
and stuffy and full of gossip. It was an apartment
loaned her by Nina de Paulhac, Nina knowing well
enough what it was to be used for. A great many
people knew, she thought, and yet what difference
did it make? Your friends were your friends no
matter what you did, and the others did not matter.
Only she must not make a fool of herself. When
women were old, love sometimes made them silly.
She mustn‚Äôt be an old fool like Mrs. Whitby, run-
ning after gigolos and dubious dukes at sixty.</p>
<p>The apartment was strange to her and there was
only Ottilia, the femme de menage, to show her
about. Ottilia knew why she was there. Well,
better that she did know. Then there wouldn‚Äôt be
any violated innocence. She wondered how many
times the apartment had been lent to others for the
same purpose.</p>
<p>Swarthy, moustached, with ox-like eyes, Ottilia
showed her the bedrooms and the two baths.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am hard,‚Äù she thought. ‚ÄúBut what of it?
God knows I‚Äôve reason to be hard. Only where
love is concerned, I am not hard. It‚Äôs always me
that suffers. You can‚Äôt be really hard if you go on
being hurt again and again.‚Äù</p>
<p>She told Ottilia to keep the supper hot. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs
impossible to ruin Italian food,‚Äù she thought. And
aloud, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm expecting a friend to dine with me.‚Äù</p>
<p>Yes. Ottilia knew. Signora de Paulhac had
written her.</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>ii6</p>
<p>She wished Ottilia wouldn‚Äôt smile like that with
her eyes. Was she smiling just because she took
that friendly interest which all Latins have in an
intrigue, or because she thought it ridiculous in a
woman of her age to have a lover? She must be
about the same age as Ottilia, although Ottilia
looked ten years older. Would Ottilia be going
downstairs to regale other servants below with the
tale? What did it matter? What did anything
matter? ‚ÄúIt is silly,‚Äù she thought, ‚Äúfor a woman
of my age and experience to behave always as if it
were the first time, always worrying what people
might say, always afraid of being caught.‚Äù There
wasn‚Äôt anybody in the world who cared if she was
caught, certainly not Faustino. A husband li]&lt;.e that
could be made cocu a thousand times in public and
he wouldn‚Äôt care at all so long as she gave him
money for electric toys and a train to run by real
steam around the garden at Venterollo ‚Äî ‚Äúlike the
children in the Bois riding to the Jardin d‚ÄôAccHma-
tation the way I used to do. My God ! How long
ago was that? I mustn‚Äôt tliink of it. I mustn‚Äôt
think. Perhaps that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve always kept my
lovers so long, because it‚Äôs always like the first time,
always a renewal, a rebirth of love, rising from its
own ashes. It was always exciting when it was like
that. There was no growing blase‚Äù</p>
<p>For a long time she lay in the hot water, allow-
ing it to soothe her, to set loose all the nerves made
taut by the wretched visit to the Villa Leonardo.
When at last she rose and dried herself, she covered
her body with a scented powder made for herself
alone, and then fell to regarding it in the mirror.</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>117</p>
<p>It was not an old body, but firm and young, and the
face was not old.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNina looks old sometimes, because she gets
tired. It‚Äôs vitality that counts in this world. It‚Äôs
the only thing. I‚Äôm never tired. Faustino was old
and tired at thirty-four when I married him.‚Äù</p>
<p>Her hair, cut short but not too short, W&rsquo;as a fine
artificial red. ‚ÄúThank Heaven,‚Äù she thought, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve
dyed it for so many years that no one remembers it
was ever any other color. It‚Äôs swimming that pre-
serves the figure. Swimming and sun and exercise.
If women would only learn that.‚Äù She thought of
Oreste and of the many women who envied her, and
she grew warm with triumph. Oreste was at least
five years younger than herself, only he didn‚Äôt know.
‚ÄúI am carnal woman,‚Äù she thought, ‚Äúand quite
pleased with myself.‚Äù She thought suddenly of the
curious piece of sculpture found in the garden of
the preposterous Mrs. Weatherby. The memory of
it gave her strange and voluputous excitement.</p>
<p>Then she put on a pale green peignoir the color
of sea-water and a collar of pearls.</p>
<p>Ill</p>
<p>There was a loggia off the salon which hung above
the river. It was quite dark now and the moon had
risen above the circling hills. The air was still hot,
but the insane wind from Africa had died away at
last.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is after nine,‚Äù she thought. ‚ÄúHe is late. He
counted on being here by seven.‚Äù</p>
<p>She walked out into the loggia and leaning on the</p>
<p>ii8 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>stone balustrade looked down. Below her the river
flowed in the moonlight a pale golden yellow,
shrunken by the drought to the size of a brook. It
smelled badly. Save for a pair of lovers the long
bare quai was empty. The lovers leaned against
the river wall, two small black figures melted Into
a single passionate shadow. Presently on the
bridge just beneath appeared the dimmed lights of a
motor.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere he is now,‚Äù she thought. The motor
turned slowly into the street below and moved to-
ward the Palazzo Blancamano, and the old feeling
of sickness swept over her. He was coming nearer
and nearer. He would stop now at the door ‚Äî She
waited, but he did not stop. The motor went slowly
on. Perhaps he had mistaken the way or did not
know the house. But that could not be. He knew
Brinoe well. He knew Nina‚Äôs apartment. Perhaps
he had had a small accident on the way, an accident
that had delayed him but not injured him, and he
had telegraphed, only they had failed to deliver the
telegram. Things like that happened in Italy. It
wasn‚Äôt any better with the FascistI, no matter how
much they said to the contrary. You couldn‚Äôt change
the whole character of a race overnight. In
America. . . . What was America like now? It
was eighteen years since she had last been there.
Queer that she always thought of it as ‚Äúhome‚Äù
when she had lived in Europe more than half her
life.</p>
<p>In one of the apartments below someone had be-
gun to play a piano and to sing. It was familiar</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>1 19</p>
<p>music but she could not place it. The voice of the
soprano was young. It sang a little uncertainly.</p>
<p>Newport. What was Newport like now? Who
lived in the old house with the ugly stone turrets?
Her room had been the one in the turret above the
porte cochere . . . the room she had left to marry
Faustino, Principe d‚ÄôOrobelli, Conte di Venterollo.
Well, it had sounded splendid enough to suit her
mother ‚Äî ^her mother, who was having an affair with
a dentist years younger than herself. Wilkins was his
name, Herbert Wilkins. We are bad blood (she
thought). But there were plenty of other girls will-
ing to take her place. Faustino was getting money
and she was becoming a Princess ‚Äî Princess d‚ÄôOro-
belli. A fool she was, knowing nothing about any-
thing . . . nothing about life. Thank God, girls
today were different, especially American girls; they
knew what they were doing.</p>
<p>There was another motor coming across the
bridge. It wasn‚Äôt Oreste. It was a camion, rum-
bling and rattling through the stillness of the night.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI mustn‚Äôt watch for him,‚Äù she thought. ‚ÄúIf I
watch it will only make him later.‚Äù</p>
<p>The voice belowstairs kept on singing. She knew
the music now. It was the Rosenkavalier ‚Äî the
music of the Feldmarschallin in the first act. The
voice was singing in French and not too good
French. Probably an American girl studying in
Italy. A Viennese opera sung in French by an
American in Brinoe. The world was getting like
that. She, an American married to an Italian, had
a Spanish lover. What did it matter ? What did
anything matter except staying young, like that fresh</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>uncertain voice and the dark pair of lovers on the
quai. The voice was like silver.</p>
<p>^^Mais comment est-il done possible que f enfant
que fetais jadis ptiisse un jour connaitre la vieil-
lessef Eire une Vteille! La Vieille Marechale!
Voyezpd est elle, la vieille PrincesseJ^</p>
<p>A bell rang somewhere in the apartment. She
listened. Surely it was the telegram, perhaps ex-
plaining why he was late. A door opened. There
was the sound of Ottilia‚Äôs voice talking to someone
with a man‚Äôs voice, and then a laugh and then the
door closing again. Ottilia would be coming nor^ in a
moment with the telegram. She stepped inside
from the loggia, but Ottilia didn‚Äôt come. What was
keeping her? When a telegram came she ought to
bring it in. Ail Italians were the same ‚Äî ^hopeless.</p>
<p>Suddenly she rang with a too great violence,
thinking at once, ‚ÄòT have lost all control of myself.
I mustn‚Äôt do that.‚Äù There was another thought in
the back of her mind which she kept pushing from
her so that she might not even recognize it for what
it was.</p>
<p>Ottilia was standing before her.</p>
<p>*The bell rang, Ottilia. Was it something for
me?‚Äù</p>
<p>^‚ÄòNo, Eccellenza. It was my cousin coming to
pay me a visit.‚Äù</p>
<p>Eccellenza! Eccellenza! Where had Ottilia
learned that absurd method of address? If I watch
for him he will never come. I must not be cross
with Ottilia. Being rude to servants Is a worse
crime in the eyes of God than adultery. Most</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>I2I</p>
<p>Latins are horrible to their servants. Faustino
treats them like dogs.</p>
<p>She found herself in the loggia, watching, watch-
ing. ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she thought, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here again, watch-
ing, without knowing it. There‚Äôs no use going back
now.‚Äù</p>
<p>She began to see herself all at once as another
woman whom she regarded from a great distance.</p>
<p>It was a funny thing what life did to you. Who
would have thought that the girl being married in
the garden at Newport would have turned into the
woman waiting in the loggia for Oreste? One
would have said that there was no connection be-
tween the two, but the chain was simple and clear
enough. It fitted together link by link, beginning
with Faustino. If a woman had a husband like
Faustino what could you expect of her? It wasn‚Äôt
in her nature to be a religieuse, wearing black and
doing good deeds. After what had happened with
Faustino she wanted only life and more life. He
hadn‚Äôt broken her. Only three months she had
lived with him, but that was long enough ‚Äî too long,
because it was long enough for her to conceive a
child, not a child, but a monster, an idiot. Her own
good blood hadn‚Äôt been strong enough to overcome
the taint of Faustino‚Äôs life and blood. It wasn‚Äôt
easy to think that your first-born was a cripple and
an idiot, and a grown man now. He must be twenty-
six, shut up always at Venterollo with his father.
She hadn‚Äôt seen him in years. How many? Well,
she wouldn‚Äôt think of that. After all, he wasn‚Äôt
much more insane than Faustino himself.</p>
<p>She‚Äôd think instead of Victor because Victor was</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>a boy to be proud of, with red hair, people said, like
his mother‚Äôs. Only her hair had never been red.
It was the red hair of his father ‚Äî ^not Faustino,
praise God, not Faustino but of Nigel. Victor
wasn‚Äôt a d‚ÄôOrobelli. He wasn‚Äôt even Italian. He
was son of Nigel Burnham.</p>
<p>Another automobile was crossing the bridge.
No, that wasn‚Äôt Oreste either. His motor was grey
and long. If I watch for him he‚Äôll never come. Ot-
tilia said her cousin. More likely it‚Äôs her lover.
I can‚Äôt go inside and sit there alone. O God, don‚Äôt
let anything happen to Oreste !</p>
<p>And Faustino didn‚Äôt care that Victor wasn‚Äôt his
son, even though he knew it. Victor was the heir,
the next Prince d‚ÄôOrobelli. He had saved the line,
Victor, the son of an English father and an Ameri-
can mother, Victor, product of six happy weeks in
Malta. I was young then. I thought I wanted to
dabble in archseology instead of life. Maybe it
would have been better; I shouldn‚Äôt be standing
here now, suffering. Six weeks in Malta. No, that
was worth all this suffering when you thought of the
happiness, even the happiness of thinking about it
now, years afterward. I am old, she thought.
Ever5rthing is measured in years now instead of
months. There had never been anything quite like
Nigel, nothing so young and clean and unspoiled.
It was probably his first affair, and mine, O God,
mine was with Faustino, my husband. A clean af-
fair like that with Nigel must be better in the eyes
of God than legitimate marriage with a beast like
Faustino. Odd how she thought of him always as
he had been in Malta in his uniform as officer of</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>123</p>
<p>His Majesty‚Äôs Navy and never as she had seen him
last in Monte Carlo, middle-aged, an admiral, with
two daughters growing up into tall blonde English
girls. Nigel was young, all youth. And she had
been young then, too, young save for the stain of
Faustino. And Victor was like Nigel, as if Nigel had
never grown old at all but simply changed into a
son. That was why she loved Victor better than
Amadeo, Jim Cain‚Äôs child.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLe temps,‚Äù sang the voice, ‚Äúest subtil comine un
poison; on ne le sent pas, tant qu^on s‚Äôaime; mais
soudain, un jour, on ne sent plus qiie liii. II est aii-

sans cesse il glisse; dans le niiroir il coule; il ride
nos pauvres visages; meme entre nous son onde
coule encore, sans bruit, silencieuse. Oh, mon
ami! . . .‚Äù</p>
<p>0 God! Stop her singing! Send Oreste safely
tome!</p>
<p>Odd how you could love in so many ways. Love
with Nigel was like the morning sunlight streaming
in at the windows. And with Jim Cain it was mixed
with pity. Jim Cain, who thought himself a gentle-
man because he hadn‚Äôt vitality enough to be positive.
It was queer how quickly families went to seed in
America, in three generations. Jim thought that
doing nothing meant being a gentleman. He was a
gentleman, but only by environment and accident.
I could have married him instead of Faustino, but
I‚Äôm glad that I didn‚Äôt. I should have died of bore-
dom with him. And I could not have betrayed him.
I‚Äôd have been so sorry for him. Jim would worry a
great deal about his honor, because he thought that</p>
<p>124</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>was one of the marks of a gentleman. And he was
dead now for three years. And Amadeo was like
him. Nobody had ever suspected Amadeo but Faus-
tino^. Faustino knew Amadeo wasn‚Äôt his child. And
Jim‚Äôs cousin Sabine, who suspected everything and
everybody . . . she even dared to speak of Amadeo</p>
<p>as ‚Äúmy cousin.‚Äù</p>
<p>&ldquo;mustn‚Äôt think these things,‚Äù she told herself.</p>
<p>It s a bad omen, as if I were really an old woman
looking back over my life. I mustn‚Äôt act as if every-
thing was finished. It isn‚Äôt finished. It isn‚Äôt fin-
ished.‚Äù</p>
<p>The thought kept pressing in upon her closer and
closer. I must push it away. I mustn‚Äôt even let it
take shape. It‚Äôs nearly eleven now. O God, send
him to me. O God, just this once more. Don‚Äôt
make me an old woman. I‚Äôm still young. My heart</p>
<p>IS young. My soul is young. O God, don‚Äôt take
him from me.</p>
<p>A motor-horn was sounding somewhere across
the river in the direction of the Palazzo Gonfarini
Its a German horn, like the one Oreste has. If f
wait, if I cross my fingers, it will turn into Oreste.
buch miracles may happen, only we never know
about them- He might have taken the road by
Monte Salvatore. No, it isn‚Äôt Oreste. It sounds
farther away now. It was going the other direction.</p>
<p>It was chinbtnff the hill toward San Marco. How
high the moon is, at the veiy top of the sky.</p>
<p>Jean could have saved me. Jean was the only
one I ever loved. Queer that never once in twenty-
five yprs have I called him Jean, but always Father
d Astier, politely, respectfully, as if there was noth-</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>125</p>
<p>ing between us. He was the only one before w&rsquo;hom
Fd have grovelled on the ground, kissing his feet
because he was a man and a good man. And it was
his goodness that spoiled everything. We could
have run away, anywhere, giving up everything, even
though he was a priest. What difference would it
have made in the end? Who would have cared?
And now he Is an old man with peace in his soul
who thinks me a harlot. It is your fault, Jean. It
is your fault. You could have taken me when you
wanted me, that time at Caporolla in the garden or
at Nina‚Äôs or the night at BrufanI‚Äôs when Fate
brought us together alone. You could have saved
me, Jean. You could have saved me! I‚Äôd have
been with you tonight happy to sit by you, instead
of here in the loggia waiting for Oreste. But you
turned your back and contented yourself with writ-
ing pious sayings in a book and looking at me in si-
lence out of your black eyes. God understands.
God must know that what you did was a sin. And
still you can have peace and faith, shutting me out.
Shutting me out.</p>
<p>(The thought was near now, far too near to be
put away.) The city is quiet. There Isn‚Äôt even the
sound of a motor-horn or the faint music from the
Piazza. The moon has passed the zenith and
everyone is in bed . . . everyone but me who stands
listening and watching in the loggia. Even the
lovers have gone away. They are young, happy
creatures, they are yomig. There are years before
them, and before me ‚Äî perhaps a single night, a
week, a month. O God, send him to me.</p>
<p>(The thought cried out aloud.) He is not com-</p>
<p>126</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>ing now. It is too late. He is never coming. It is
all over now. I am too old. Tomorrow he will
write me giving excuses and letting me know that
it‚Äôs ended and again I shall be hurt as if I‚Äôd never
learned anything. O God, don‚Äôt let me be hurt this
last time, this last time when I am saying good-by
to youth, to love, to everything. Love, God, that‚Äôs
all I‚Äôve ever had. I‚Äôm not a clever woman. I‚Äôm not
a good woman. I‚Äôve never had anything but love.</p>
<p>She found her nails digging into the stone of the
balustrade. ‚ÄúI must go in now,‚Äù she thought. ‚ÄúI
mustn‚Äôt stand here any longer. I‚Äôm being a fool,
an old fool like Kitty Whitby. I mustn‚Äôt do that.
I‚Äôve alwaj&rsquo;-s been discreet. I‚Äôve been dignified. O
God, if only You had given me faith and peace like
Jean. O God, it was You and the Church who took
Jean from me. I‚Äôd have been a good wife to him.</p>
<p>He‚Äôs not coming now. He‚Äôs never coming at all.
It‚Äôs too late. It‚Äôs all over.</p>
<p>She went inside and threw herself down on the
sofa, where she lay for a long time not knowing
what she thought, or even w&rsquo;hether she was alive.
And slowly when she had wept and wept she began
to feel calm again and cool.</p>
<p>I must not be a fool, she told herself. It‚Äôs over
now and there‚Äôs nothing to be done. I must make
the most of it. Perhaps if I pray God will send me
peace and faith. I must be an old woman now. I
must go out in dignity. It‚Äôs time now. Victor is
a man now and he mustn‚Äôt hear people laugh at his
mother. The past is the past, but Victor is old
enough now to understand. Victor, Nigel‚Äôs son.</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 127</p>
<p>Nigel, who was like the morning sun streaming in
at tiie windows. He is getting old, too.</p>
<p>She rose and rang the bell and standing in the
shadow so that Ottilia should not see she had been
weeping, she told her to serve the supper and then
go to bed.</p>
<p>I must not let her know that he is not coming. I
must not let her know that it matters to me. Aloud
she said, ‚ÄúYou can leave the supper on the table,
ril serve myself.‚Äù</p>
<p>Ottilia knew that he wasn‚Äôt coming. You could
tell by the look in her ox-like eyes. They weren‚Äôt
smiling any longei-. They had in them a gleam of
sympathy. That was because the ‚Äúcousin‚Äù was a
lover. Ottilia understood. To be pitied by a ser-
vant! In love women were all of one kind. There
were no princesses and no servants.</p>
<p>When Ottilia had placed the supper on the table
and gone away, the Princess rose and going into the
bathroom disposed of the soup and a portion of the
vegetables so that in the morning Ottilia would not
think that she had been unable to eat. She did this
in the proper order so that if Ottilia came in sud-
denly she would not find all the food disposed of
miraculously at once. But Ottilia did not return.</p>
<p>Then she drank coffee, thinking perhaps if I stay
awake and pray all night God will send me faith
and peace like Jean‚Äôs. She took out the Thomas-a-
Kempis that Jean had given her long ago, and tried
to read it. It was a thing she carried with her al-
ways, more precious than her pearls, not because
of what it contained, but because he had given it to
her. He had held it in his hands and had written</p>
<p>128</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>in it. He had beautiful hands. She always saw
them when she read out of the Tiiomas-a-Kempis.
She read from what he had written with hi^ beauti-
ful hands.</p>
<p>Dans la damnation le feti est la moindre chose;
le snpplice propre ati damne est le progrh infint
dans le vice et dans le crimes V ame s^endurcissant^
se depravant t ou jours ^ enfoncant necessairement

pendant Veternite,</p>
<p>Michelet.</p>
<p>That w^as true, but its truth did not change the
‚ñ†ways of humanity. It went on just the same. It
was a clever thought, but not strong enough to
overcome and subdue the body that shut you in, a
prisoner. I will wear black, she thought, and de-
vote myself to hospitals and the poor. Perhaps a
legend will grow up about me ‚Äî the woman who had
given all to life and turned in the end to God and
the church. That would be a fitting end to the
story, a fine way to end it, and it was only the end
that mattered now.</p>
<p>She wept a little, pitying herself, and then read
some more out of the little book? passages which she
had read many times.</p>
<p>‚Äò‚ÄòO Lord, let that become possible to me by Thy
grace, which by nature seemed impossible to me,</p>
<p>‚Äò‚ÄòThou knowest that I am able to suffer but little,
and that I am quickly cast down, when a slight ad-
versary arlseth.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor Thy Name‚Äôs sake, let every tribulation be
made pleasant and desirable to me : for to suffer and</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>to be disquieted for Thy sake is very wholesome for
my soul.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúJean sought to cure me,‚Äù she thought, ‚Äúby giv-
ing me a book when he should have given me him-
self.‚Äù</p>
<p>Perhaps if I read now God will reward me and
send Oreste, after all. But that is foolish. I have
jiever prayed to God except when I am unhappy.
He must remember that. I only come to Him when
I want to beg something of Him. No, the end must
be in black. All great harlots become pious in their
old age, as if faith could take the place of love.</p>
<p>She tried to read, but she did not know what she
was reading. She kept thinking of the excuses
Oreste would write tomorrow and thinking, ‚ÄúIf I
wear black I had best go to Worth. He will make
me look discreet and respectable and chic. I shall
be able to wear black without becoming an old
horror. Satin I shall wear and black velvet. How
people will talk when I am no longer seen about,
when they hear that I have shut myself up at Vente-
rollo with Faustino and my idiot son. Perhaps they
will come and see me there. Surely God won‚Äôt mind
that. I can have Nina come. I can even have peo-
ple to stay. God wouldn‚Äôt mind that.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut he that is wise and well-instructed in the
Spirit is raised above these mutable things : not heed-
ing what he feeleth in himself, of which way the
wind of instability bloweth; but studies only that his
mind may be directed to its supreme and final good.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor thus he will be able to continue throughout
one and the selfsame, and unshaken. . . .‚Äù</p>
<p>She tried to read on and on, calming her soul with</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>130</p>
<p>the long, quiet, beautiful periods, but she could not
see the page for the feeling of sickness which came
over her. People, she thought, must feel like this
when they are condemned to death. For me to be
old is to die.</p>
<p>Suddenly she flung herself down once more on
the sofa and began to weep. It was no use. It was
all over. She hadn‚Äôt it in her to shut herself away
from life. And she never loved Oreste as much as
she had loved him tonight. O God, send him to me.
No, I must not do that. (She sat up.) I will
be courageous. It is all over. Tomorrow I will
go to Jean and ask him where I can go into retreat,
to begin another life. I will break completely with
the past and never see any of them again, not even
Nina. (She rose and walked to the mirror.) I am
old now. I should never w^eep. It makes me look
weary like Nina. It‚Äôs only then that I look really
old. I am old. I am finished. I must find peace
now in God. I must go out in a beautiful dignity.
If I say It over and over again, I will believe it and
have peace . . . peace such as Jean has. I am old.
I am old. I am old.</p>
<p>It did make her feel more calm, more peaceful.
She sat down once more and opened the Imitation

someone else. I dare not touch the handle. I will
call out his name. Then it can‚Äôt change into some-

<p>She stood trembling, making a great effort, and
at last she was able to say In a weak voice, ‚ÄúOreste.‚Äù</p>
<p>From the other side came his voice, the voice.</p>

<p>She tore open the door and he stood there telling
her that he had had an accident in a remote valley.
And she thought, ‚ÄúI must not cry. When I cry I
look old.‚Äù But her whole body was shaking with
sobs. For no reason at all she was suddenly aware</p>

<p>THE CRIME OF MEEKER‚ÄôS GULCH</p>
<p>I ‚ñ†</p>
<p>F rom the day that Annie and Uriah Spragg left
Cordova their existence drifted into a strange
state that w^as something more and something less
than human. In all their obscure wanderings it
appears that they were hounded like the figures
out of a Greek tragedy by some fate which gave
them no peace, shutting them further and further
away from the world into the solitude of their own
souls. It may have been that the consciousness of
their own queerness set them apart, or it may have
been as Signora Bardelli, the janitress, believed long
afterwmrd ‚Äî that Miss Annie Spragg sold her soul
to the Devil, a bargain she made perhaps on the
day that Uriah found the body of Leander Potts
lying in her bower by the bend of the river. Per-
haps she preferred the Devil to such a God as
Uriah worshipped. The same strange thing that
shut them in from the world bound them to each
other in a lonely solitude.</p>
<p>On fleeing Cordova they fell back once more into
that life which they had led so long as children of the
Prophet. From town to town they went and from
village to village and crossioad to crossroad, carry-</p>
<p>MISS AxNNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>133^</p>
<p>ing the word of Uriah‚Äôs harsh God into the wilder-
ness* But it was a life neither as pleasant nor as
comfortable as life had been in the days of the
Prophet, for there was nothing about the voice or
the face or the body of Uriah v^hich stirred men to
tears of repentance and women to frenzies of hys-
teria. Uriah was merely repellent and cold. Gifts
of money and of food must have been slender and
infrequent and Annie, it appears, beyond pumping
the wheezy melodion for the services, did nothing
to help her brother. Nevertheless in those days a
man of God v/as looked upon as touched by a Divine
fire that set him aside from other men, and so Uriah
was tolerated and respected.</p>
<p>They accomplished most in remote and lonely
communities where the arrival of a traveling
preacher was the peak of excitement from one year‚Äôs
end to another, where souls were craving salvation
as a change from the monotonies of harsh v/eather
and dreary landscape. But Annie Spragg contrib-
uted nothing save that uncertain touch upon the
melodion. Even that disturbing power of seduction
come down to her from the Prophet she seemed to
have armored and locked away in the depths of her
wounded soul. More and more she became a soli-
tary, more and more she wandered through woods
and fields, taking for her friends only the birds and
the animals.</p>
<p>At some period duifing their long wanderings
(and they went as far west as Boise and as far east
as Carthage) Uriah came at last to be ordained a
legitimate preacher, qualified by his church and fit
to be given a flock and a house where he might rest</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>134</p>
<p>a little from his long and wandering atonement.
But even then God saw fit to give- him only a little
peace, for wherever he went, he was driven on again
in a little time. People disliked him and they dis-
trusted the queer Annie and her silent, mysterious
ways. Uriah‚Äôs hatred of women grew with advanc-
ing age and as women were the best defenders of
priests he failed in his mission, for his female
parishioners came to look upon him as a poor thing
who was a feeble preacher with a harsh, weak voice
in which there was only the monotonous grey and
bitter scale of denunciation. The women of a
parish were the natural antagonists of a preacher‚Äôs
wife and she of them, and Annie Spragg was worse
than the most helpless clergyman‚Äôs wife. The
women she ignored. She did not call upon them or
go to the Ladies‚Äô Aid or make mother hubbards for
the missionary society. She merely sat at home,
mysterious and silent, surrounded by the outlandish
wild things she had made her pets.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>And so at last when Uriah Spragg had passed his
fiftieth birthday, they came to the church at Winne-
bago Falls, a miserable and dying parish worthy only
of one whose life had been a failure. The building
itself was a primitive affair of unpainted wood, long
in need of repair, which stood in a poor part of the
town between the railroad yards and the river, and
his flock was made up of the remnants of a migra-
tion of poor whites who, abandoned by their
Strength in the course of a western migration, had</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>135</p>
<p>settled down in apathy along the mud fiats. They
were a poor lot, undernourished, superstitious and
fearful. Most of them could not read or write,
but they were all Children of God who possessed
souls, and Uriah, whose only ambition was atone-
ment, took up his task without complaint.</p>
<p>The preacher‚Äôs house stood on the outskirts of the
town, a poor wooden afi&rsquo;air like the church, half
hidden from a highway which was neither city street
nor country road, by great cottonwoods and a
thicket of untended lilacs, syringas and woodbine.
Great clumps of burdock, emblem of poverty and
the sordid, had taken possession of the yard and
grew close against the old house. Beyond it
stretched an abandoned terrain grown over with
sumach and wild cherries, which in summer served
mercifully to hide the fragments of old buggies and
baby-carriages, tin cans and bicycles, dumped there
when they ceased to be any longer of use to the
citizens of Winnebago Falls.</p>
<p>Into this house Uriah and Annie Spragg moved
the few primitive things which made up their house-
hold furniture. The pay was three hundred dollars
a year and ‚Äúcontributions,‚Äù but ‚Äúcontributions‚Äù
from a flock which itself lingered on the fringes of
stai&rsquo;vation could not have been great. Still they
were for a little time secure and safe from change,
since it was impossible to assign Uriah to a lower
charge.</p>
<p>Not long after they had moved in, Annie Spragg
was discovered foraging along the river and on the
fringes of the dump heap, collecting bits of wood.
With these she constructed by her own hands a crude</p>
<p>136 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>enclosure which she began to fill wfith pets. To the
members of her brother‚Äôs new flock she remained a
mystery, since no one spoke to her even when they
came to the house, unless by chance she happened
to open the door and usher them in silence into a
parlor furnished -with three chairs, a worn carpet,
tv/o religious chromos and a rubber-plant. People
saw‚Äô&rsquo; her sometimes in the town, wandering along the
street, peering into shop windows at things which
she could never afford to buy. She had begun even
at that date to appear extremely eccentric. Her
clothes were queer and out of date, with a skirt
which always trailed far behind her through dust or
mud, regardless of the weather. But she was very
clean, and even in those days wmre white cotton
gloves. People who encountered her at the door of
Uriah‚Äôs house noticed that she wore them even when
opening the door, and Mrs. Bosanky, the drunken
old Irish wmman who came up sometimes from the
fiats to help her clean the house, said that Miss
Annie wore the gloves even when cooking and clean-
ing and doing the washing.</p>
<p>Within the crude enclosure among the burdocks
at the back of the house there came to be sheltered
rabbits and guinea-pigs, three or four stray cats, a
crow with a broken wing and an old and bo.ny mon-
grel dog &lsquo;W‚Äô-hose broken leg Miss Annie Spragg had
mended with great care. The thicket about the
house had long been a refuge for birds and after she
came their numbers increased. People said it was
strange that Miss Annie Spragg‚Äôs cats never an-
noyed the birds and that even bluejays and sparrows</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 137</p>
<p>lived in the thicket in peace with more timid winged
things.</p>
<p>And then one morning old Mrs. Bosanky arrived
leading on a string a young he-goat that had been
left behind by an Irish family which had set out for
Oregon. He was a fine creature, with black intelli-
gent eyes and a long fine shining coat as black as
night. And after a time the town became used to
a new sight, more extraordinary than any of the
others. It saw Miss Annie Spragg walking in the
evenings after her work was done along the road
toward Meeker‚Äôs Gulch, a lonely and almost im-
penetrable marshy thicket some four miles to the
north. The he-goat walked beside her in the most
docile fashion without even the constraint of a lead-
ing string, and when dogs ran out from the houses
along the road to bai-k at the queer figure of Miss
Annie Spragg, he arched his back prettily and bent
his head and beat the earth with his pretty shining
black hoofs. She took him there to feed upon the
wild sweet clover that grew high on the edges of the
country road. Sometimes when people passed along
the i*oad w&rsquo;hile the goat was feeding, they encoun-
tered the green eyes of Miss Annie Spragg watching
them through the black veil she always wore, and
they hurried on, filled with the nameless and an-
cestral fear that attacks children in the dark.</p>
<p>Ill</p>
<p>Uriah, too, sometimes walked along the county
road that led to Meeker‚Äôs Gulch, but never at the
hour of sunset. He chose the morning and the mid¬´</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>138</p>
<p>die of the day. Heat seemed to have no effect upon
his great shambling body, not even the thick damp
heat of the fertile prairies. He was fifty-one and
then fifty-two and life and the atonement he had
planned seemed only to withdraw further and fur-
ther from him. There were men and women who
presently had stopped coming to his church and
others who, for reasons he could not understand,
hated him. He had done his best, his duty; he had
been hard and conscientious toward Annie as well as
toward himself, yet none loved him, none asked his
aid. He still possessed his gigantic physical
strength, but he was becoming an old man, with hair
turning white. The bitter chiselled lines in his face
were becoming great hard gashes that gave the
countenance a perpetual look of anger and hatred.
The pale blue eyes sank deeper and deeper into their
cavernous sockets. And the ungainly body, denied
since the beginning the pleasures for which nature
intended it, began like the bodies of those who abuse
the pleasures of the flesh to be racked with obscure
but devastating pains. At times he could no longer
stand erect for the pain in his spine. People saw
him day after day walking along the country road,
his body bent with pain, still in the same old posture,
with the great bony hands clasped behind him,
composing his bitter sermons as he walked or calling
fiercely upon God for strength.</p>
<p>There had never been much love In the harsh body
and even the little that there had been appeared to
have burned itself out in the flame of his strange
passion for Leander Potts. But neither was there
any hate in him, but only that thing which is less than</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>139</p>
<p>iiuman ‚Äî -duty and the sense of atonement for the
sins of his father the Prophet and for the sins of his
unchaste sister. He came at last never to walk in
the town but always in the open country. Once a
year he went away to attend for three days the con-
vention of his church. It was his only diversion.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>Among the farmers who lived along the road to
Meeker‚Äôs Gulch there was one of German descent
called Ed Hasselnian, who kept cows and supplied
milk for most of the citizens of Winnebago Falls.
He was a hard-working man, but the curse of drink
was on him. Sometimes he would stay sober for
months and then one day the appetite would take
possession of him and he would become like a mad-
man, staying drunk for days and weeks. Sometimes
it was whiskey and sometimes it was only hard cider,
but his drunkenness possessed always the same wild
quality of bestiality. At such times he was seized
with nightmare visions and went out of his mind,
and then a woman called Marla Hazlett who kept
house for him would have to deliver the milk in
Winnebago Falls. When she appeared the whole
town knew that Ed Hasselman was drunk again.
She was a fat, blousy woman with a moustache and
Ed Hasselman had never married her, but she was
accepted as next best to being his wife. No one
knew her well, for she was a silent woman who ap-
peared to accept all that life brought her without
comment or complaint. She was never heard even
to complain of Ed Hasselman‚Äôs drunkenness and</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>140</p>
<p>the long hours of back-breaking work which it
imposed upon her. She seemed content with him.
She had been an illegitimate child, brought up on the
county poor farm, and at eighteen she had gone to
work for Ed Hasselman when his wife was still
alive. When the wife died Maria Elazlett simply
stayed on.</p>
<p>One morning, a day or two after Uriah Spragg
had gone oS to the annual church convention in Du-
buque, Maria Hazlett appeared delivering the milk
and as she went from house to house she spread a
strange story, telling it alike to hired girls, house-
wives and men she met in the street. It went
through all the town.</p>
<p>She said that in the early morning when Ed Has-
selman had gone out to the barn to help her with
the milking, he had seen the figure of Miss Annie
Spragg black against the sunrise hurrying across the
open fields from the direction of Meeker‚Äôs Gulch and
with her Vi^as the black he-goat. She was not going
toward Meeker‚Äôs Gulch, mind you, but away from
it, back to town. Ed had been drinking a little,
Maria Hazlett said, but not enough so that he didn‚Äôt
know what he was seeing.</p>
<p>Some put the story down as a drunken hallucina-
tion of the milkman and others guarded it, turning it
over in their minds, savoring all its possibilities, but
in the end everyone came to know it and it served
only to deepen the isolation w&rsquo;hich surrounded the
strange brother and sister. They came to be looked
upon a little as though they were strange animals
brought from a far country, which might be re-
garded safely from a distance. Here and there in</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 141</p>
<p>the town, but mostly among the members of Uriah
Spragg‚Äôs own flock, murmurs began to arise against
them, and strange rumors that they were both mad
and that Miss Annie Spragg at least deserved being
shut up. Surely it was not respectable to have such
a woman as the sister of one‚Äôs preacher, and some-
times people who belonged to other churches ‚Äî
Methodists and Baptists and even the haughty Con-
gregationalists ‚Äî treated the Reverend Uriah Spragg
and his sister as comic figures. But worst of all, the
old black story of the Prophet, leader of the Spragg-
ites, never long dead, raised its head. It was a
story never far distant in the memories of all the
prairie people and in the years since the Prophet‚Äôs
mysterious end it had grown in exaggeration and un-
wholesome detail. Uriah and Annie Spragg were
two of the products of the Prophet‚Äôs colossal lust
and as such were the accursed of God and the be-
loved of the Devil. There was even talk of riding
Uriah Spragg out of town upon a rail, and there
were dark stories that Annie Spragg was much more
to him than a sister.</p>
<p>It came to a crisis one hot Sunday morning in
August v/hen Uriah Spragg went as usual to preach
to the remnants of his flock in the decaying wooden
church, and he found his own church door locked
against him. Across it had been nailed three planks
and on one of these was fastened a bit of paper on
which was written in half-illiterate handwriting :</p>
<p>To the Reverend Uriah Spragg,</p>
<p>W e want none of the spawn of Cyrus Spragg.</p>
<p>We want no more of you.</p>
<p>142</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>JVe want a good preacher or none at alL</p>
<p>We are sick of being laughed at.</p>
<p>Until further warning the church will be closed.</p>
<p>Take warning and do not try to force yourself
where you are not wanted.</p>
<p>{Signed)</p>
<p>John Hemphill.</p>
<p>Darius Curtis.
Alexander BosHvick.</p>
<p>{Committee.)</p>
<p>He did not attempt to tear loose the planks and
force an entrance to his church. For a little time he
simply stood quite still in the high grass staring at
the paper, and then, turning slowly, he walked away
with his head bowed and his great cruel hands be-
hind his tired back. As he left the churchyard,
passing through the rusted gate, there arose behind
him from the thicket of sumach a loud derisive
laugh. The committee had been hiding there to
watch him.</p>
<p>It was the end. There was nothing left.</p>
<p>V,</p>
<p>At two o‚Äôclock In the afternoon of the same day
Maria Hazlett, drowsing in the heat with the
reins hanging loose over the dashboard of the milk-
wagon, was roused sharply. Her team had shied
at something that lay on the edge of the road and
very nearly threw the wagon into the ditch. Stir-
ring herself to action, she halted the team to find
that almost beside her, among the high sweet clover,</p>
<p>143</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>lay the body of a man. Being a courageous and un-
squeamish woman used to hard farm work and
butchering, she got down heavily and turned the
body over on its back. She saw then that it was the
Reverend Uriah Spragg, and that although the body
was still warm he was quite dead. It needed
Maria‚Äôs calloused nature to regard the sight with-
out turning ill. His face was no longer the face of
Uriah Spragg, but she recognized him by the white
hair, the rusty black clothes and the great hands
that were like the cruel claws of a bird of prey. He
had been beaten savagely from head to foot by some
sharp instrument. Even his clothing had been
ripped and torn in the mad fury of the attack.</p>
<p>There was no one in sight. The murder had
been done at noonday on the county road in the very
midst of the flat prairie where there was neither
tree nor bush nor dwelling to hide the murderer.</p>
<p>VI</p>
<p>All that day and during most of the night crowds
streamed out the county road to stare morbidly at
the spots of blood in the dust at the edge of the tall
sweet clover. Crowds hung over the fence of the
old house where they took Uriah‚Äôs broken body back
to his sister Annie. Crowds trampled the vulgar
burdocks into the ground. No one saw Miss Annie
Spragg save the sherifi and two sweating and stupid
policemen who said that she received them in white
gloves and took the news calmly enough ‚Äî ‚ÄúAlthough
that maybe was because she was cracked.‚Äù</p>
<p>After three days they buried him, and Miss Annie</p>
<p>144 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>Spragg, who did not take the trouble to put on black
or put off her fiower-triramed picture hat, tacked up
a notice on the front fence that she was going away
and that her furniture was for sale. She would
have gone perhaps overlooked and in solitude as
she had always been, but for the dark rumors which
began to be heard. It was said outright that she
had killed her brother and that everyone knew that
crazy people were far craftier than sane ones. At
last a committee from Uriah‚Äôs own church, feeling
perhaps that they were not above suspicion, called
upon the sheriff to make an investigation and ‚Äúclear
the honor of Hanna County by fixing the guilt for
the murder of the Reverend Uriah Spragg.‚Äù Peo-
ple, moved perhaps by some dark mistrust, began
to hint that the black he-goat had played some
part in the crime. No one had found the weapon
‚Ä¢with which Uriah Spragg had been beaten to death
and Joe Hutton, the undertaker, told a story that
the wounds on his body were like those that might
have been made by the twin prongs of a pair of
horns. It was true that since the day of the murder
no one had seen the he-goat.</p>
<p>And so they arrested Miss Annie Spragg and
questioned her, although they could draw no intel-
ligible story from her muddled and perhaps crafty
answers. Next they searched her, calling in two
women from Uriah‚Äôs church to strip her naked,
She made no resistance, only looking at them quietly
out of her disturbing green eyes. At the very be-
ginning when they took off the white cotton gloves
they made a strange discovery. On the palms and
the backs of both hands there were red scars, as if</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>t4S</p>
<p>they had been branded there with a hot iron, and as
they undressed her they found other scars like them
on the tops and soles of her feet and one on her right
side just below her breast; and on her brow under
the fringe of thick red hair were other scars that
might have been burned there by placing on her head
a crown of jagged hot metal. On her back were the
healed blue scars of flogging. But they could get
from her no answer as to how she came by these
scars. Though dearly they were the scars of
wounds, she led them craftily to believe that she had
been born thus.</p>
<p>Awed a little and unable to find even a suspicion
of her guilt, they let her go back in peace to the old
house behind the lilacs, following close behind her
in order to search the place. In the bare small
room where Uriah Spragg had slept they found a
long cruel blacksnake whip and across the hall in
the room of Miss Annie Spragg they discovered a
strange contrivance which at first puzzled them. It
consisted of a rusty pump-chain, fastened in the mid-
dle to one of the beams in the ceiling just above the
bed. To the two ends were attached crude hand-
cuffs fastened with locks equally crude. They ques-
tioned Miss Annie Spragg for two hours and at the
end of that time they learned that Uriah Spragg had
locked her into the handcuffs each night after she
had gone to bed. Only on three nights a year when
he had gone to the church convention was she free.</p>
<p>At the back of the house a crowd of curious gath-
ered once more, peering in at the windows and
breaking down the cellar door, for the mob no longer
looked upon Annie Spragg as a human creature with</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>146</p>
<p>the rights of a citizen like themselves, but a kind of
monster who filled them with a hungry desire to
destroy her. There seems to have been an un-
natural intensity in their feeling against her. She
was to them no longer a woman, or even human.
At length three bold citizens in an excess of virtue
broke down the fence built so laboriously by the
hand of Miss Annie Spragg herself to shelter her
pets, and thei*e on the beaten yellow earth they
found what they sought ‚Äî three great stains made
by blood.</p>
<p>It was then that old Mrs, Bosanky, for once sober
and in her right mind, pushed through the crowd and
told her story. Miss Annie Spragg, she said, could
not have committed the murder because she, Mrs.
Bosanky, had been in the house all day on the day
that Uriah Spragg was found beaten to death on
the edge of the county road. She took her oath to
it, calling upon the Virgin Mary and ail the Irish
saints to witness that she was telling the truth. She
explained delicately that she had not told her story
until now because the murder had upset her and
since then she had been drinking a little in order to
quiet herself.</p>
<p>But the blood ‚Äî She could explain that too. It
was the blood of the pretty black he-goat. On the
morning of the day the Reverend Uriah Spragg
was murdered, he had killed it himself with an axe.</p>
<p>VII</p>
<p>Since they could find nothing against Miss Annie
Spragg save that she was a little moonstruck, they</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>147</p>
<p>dropped the case and annoyed her no more, and the
mystery remained unsolved, an epic in the history
of a town where little ever happened. Some even
felt a little sorry for her when the stories got about
that she had been beaten and branded by her
brother, but none approached her save drunken old
Mary Bosanky.</p>
<p>She went away at last, so quietly that no one knew
she had gone until long afterward. Only Mrs. Bo-
sanky knew where she had gone, for she had asked
her and received the answer, ‚ÄúTo Italy.‚Äù And
when Mrs. Bosanky asked her why, she had
answered, ‚ÄúBecause I lived there once.‚Äù And Mrs.
Bosanky, who could neither read nor write, thought
Italy must be a town in the next county and took no
more notice of it.</p>
<p>FATHER D‚ÄôASTIER‚ÄôS STORY</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>&ldquo;LTE WAS born of mixed blood. On his father‚Äôs
side he was French and on his mother‚Äôs Italian,
and the two bloods had been at war within him since
the day he was born. Until the day he died they
would battle there in his body and in his mind. In
youth the struggle had been incomplete and con-
fused, but with age the two demons came to divide,
each withdrawing a little into his own corner, and
with the clearness of division there had come a cer-
tain peace, for Father d‚ÄôAstier understood that he
was two persons and not one and that there was no
merging the one into the other. The one man was</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>148</p>
<p>a mystic, and gullible and sentimental, of that blood
which painted smiling Madonnas and miraculous
children seated in fields starred with impossible
flowers beneath throngs of pretty angels. The other
was of the blood of the philosophers, of Voltaire
and the eighteenth century, a creature Inquiring and
restless, skeptical and touched with the despair of
those who stand in awe of that which they are too
proud to believe. All that was French in him found
satisfaction In facing the truth and knowing it how-
ever unpleasant it might be.</p>
<p>There w- as in him, too, a monster, born perhaps of
the long struggle in! his soul. This, too, at sixty he
knew well. He had known It for a long time now.
It was a monster not easy to tame, perverse and
cruel, which sometimes claimed possession of his
very soul and destroyed what he loved best.</p>
<p>He was thinking of these things when the Princess
dropped him before the door of his own house, a
great house which he owned, for he was a rich man,
and in which he kept for himself only two small
rooms under the eaves looking down upon the
square beneath the lovely tower of San Stefano. Of
those who occupied his house he knew nothing.
They lived their lives beneath him, lives that were
tangled and complex, tragic or comic, pathetic and
nondescript. He preferred not knowing his tenants.
And he owned, too, the old rookery called the
Palazzo Gonfarini where this strange woman Miss
Annie Spragg had died. But as he climbed the
stairs, a little wearily, he was not thinking of Miss
Annie Spragg but of his own life and the life of Anna
TOrobelli.</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>149</p>
<p>He was tired. That long motor ride had worn
his nerves. And then the discovery of that obscene
but beautiful statue had been disturbing. A thing
like that was better hidden forever in the dark earth
of that ancient garden. It stirred up the demons.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am growing old,‚Äù he thought. ‚ÄúYet she seems
as young as ever. She is a remarkable woman.‚Äù</p>
<p>She had not tricked him. He knew well enough
why she had been in such haste. Had he not known
her for nearly thirty years, better perhaps than any
man, better even than any of her lovers, for there
was a side of her known to him which they would
never know? She was a woman, he thought, born
out of her time, a woman who might have been a
grande amoureuse, or a great courtesan. She was
always in haste, always unsatisfied, like a flame, al-
ways seeking, seeking, seeking something. What
could it have been? Love, perhaps, or something
more than that, if indeed there were anything
greater than that. Perhaps she had been seeking
always a man whom she could find worthy of her,
to receive all that she had to give. Such a man
might have saved her, but it was too late now. She
would never find him. She was growing old and to
seek love when one was old was to be ridiculous.
The thought hurt him, as it had hurt him many times
during the past year or two, when he had heard her
name mentioned in jest, when people had told stories
against her. Women did not like her and that was
natural, but men had come of late to talk of her. It
was like an audience of dolts witnessing a great play
which they had not the capacity to understand. A
whole life wasted. They did not know her as he</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>ISO</p>
<p>knew her. They could not understand why it hurt
him when they laughed.</p>
<p>He turned the key and let himself into the two
small rooms. They were like twin cells, sparsely
furnished, with plain oak tables and chairs, a cup-
board. &hellip; It was here that he came when he
wanted peace and rest from the world, when he had
need to retire and fight the demon that sometimes
claimed his soul. This time he had come all the way
from a country house in Shropshire so that he might
be alone. And now he was to have no solitude be-
cause he had found Anna d‚ÄôOrobelli in Brinoe and
because Fulco chose to torment him with all the non-
sense about the Spragg woman being a saint. He
was to have no peace because he had found there
the two people in all the world whose presence tor-
mented him most.</p>
<p>He did not bother to send for a hot supper. He
ate the cheese and wine and bread which he always
kept in the cupboard, eating in a room that was dark
save for the splashes of moonlight on the floor.
Fulco would be coming in a little while. It would
be time enough then to have a light.</p>
<p>He thought again, ‚ÄúPeople do not know how it
hurts me when they laugh at her. They do not
know that I shall die wondering if I was not the
one chosen by God to save her.‚Äù Perhaps saving her
would have been in the sight of God more worthy
than all the souls he had brought to the Church,
cowardly, worldly, sniveling souls, most of them.
But who could decide a thing like that? Certainly
not the Church, filled with men no nearer to God
than himself and most of them far more stupid. It</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 151</p>
<p>required charity to understand such things and only
God had charity. And who could know that there
was a God? He had been honest with the Church,
he told himself. He had never let men know that
he doubted these things.</p>
<p>The struggle was beginning again. He saw it
now. He was too old to fight against it any longer,
but there was a part of him that would not leave
him in peace ‚Äî that part which would not lie down
shamelessly in the calm which appeared to envelop
those who never asked questions.</p>
<p>He did not see Anna now as he had seen her a
little while before in the loggia of that preposterous
woman at the Villa Leonardo. He kept seeing her
as he had seen her years before when they were both
young, when ‚Äî (why did he keep on tormenting
himself?) when it could have happened. And now
it was too late. There was no living life over again.
There was only that single straight narrow groove,
the record of each life, which was soon worn away
and forgotten when you were dead. Who would
remember you when you were dead? Who would
care what you had done, what pleasures you had
known and what sorrows? What difference could
it have made? It would not have been an easy
thing, what with his having been Father d‚ÄôAstier
and she the Princess d‚ÄôOrobelli. Could they have
dared such a thing, and faced life confident in each
other, finding In each enough to throw away all else ?
She would have gone In recklessly, greedily. Per-
haps her way was better, after all, taking life as it
came, squeezing it for the last drop of color and fire
and beauty.</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>152</p>
<p>His agony was that it was too late now. He
would die without ever knowing. If he had taken
the wrong turning, it could not be undone now. And
she had gone on and on all these years, wasting her-
self and all she had to give prodigally and without
restraint. Perhaps in the eyes of God he had com-
mitted the greatest of sins. If God and Nature
were one, he w^as the greatest of sinners. The
Church taught otherwise, but the Church, the
Church. . ‚Ä¢ . The Church had far less in common
with God than Nature had. As it grew older, the
Church seemed to have less and less. For forty
years he had been serving the Church like an honest
servant, no more, no less. For forty 5^ears he had
been atoning for the first sin, and surely by now he
had atoned. Flad he not brought souls to God?
Sotils to God? The phrase echoed bitterly inside
his head like a phrase spoken aloud in an empty
room. Souls to God, Souls who had wanted to
come to God because they were worldly or because
they were afraid of life and needed to believe in a
pretty story that was considered holy and could not
be denied. And at the end there was always
Heaven, not a fine, noble, splendid Heaven, but a
Paradise like the Primitives‚Äô, filled with pink and
blue angels and God in a blue robe. He had brought
souls to God, but not his own soul. It was still
the same as it had been at seventeen before he
had known anything of life, a little more placid,
perhaps, and more resigned, but not much dIT
ferent. Sixty years of life had not proven any-
thing. He was no nearer the mystery now than he
had ever been. Sometimes he fancied that God</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG iS3</p>
<p>was perhaps on his side smiling at the antics of all
the others.</p>
<p>And suddenly he thought with shame of what he
had written on the first empty white page of the
Thomas-a-KempIs he had given Anna so long ago.</p>
<p>Dans la damnation le feu est la moindre chose;
le stipplice propre au damne est le progres infini
dans le vice et dans le crime, fame s‚Äôendurcissant,
&lsquo;se depravant toujoiirs, s^efifoncant necessairement
dans le inal de minute en progression geometrique
pendant Veternite.</p>
<p>Michelet.</p>
<p>He had written that. He who could have saved
her.</p>
<p>What did it all mean, what did it all matter?
There was Anna a little way off with Oreste Fuen-
terrabia searching, searching for what Oreste Fuen-
terrabia could never give her, and what she could
never find now. Soon they would both be dead. Ten
more years. Twenty more years. The sooner, the
better now for Anna. She was not made to be
old. For himself it did not matter. Nothing could
happen to him now. He was tired tonight and he
had yet to deal with Fulco and all his stupidity, to
keep Fulco from making a fool of himself. Fulco,
who would not see that the world was what it was
and that Christ had come too soon. There were
those who believed that Jesus would come again.
Perhaps when he came again the world would not
reject him ‚Äî this world of priests and preachers, of
statesmen and barterers and politicians and cheats</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>154</p>
<p>and idle women, a world ridden with greed and am-
bition. He knew the world. Fie had lived in it for
a long time. He knew those who ruled the world.
The poor were humble, but the poor in power would
be no different. No, he had seen too much of the
world, years and years too much.</p>
<p>There was a sound of footsteps on the stairs and
he put down the glass of wine to listen. He knew
the steps. They were Fulco‚Äôs, shuffling, timid, un-
certain. Fie knew the creaking boots. For some
reason Fulco‚Äôs boots al‚Äôways creaked. He rose and
lighted a candle, w&rsquo;earily, for he would rather have
received Fulco in the dark. There was a knock on
the door, a timid, apologetic knock. It was his past
knocking. It w^as his fiery, unhappy youth. There
were people, he thought bitterly, who said that
youth was the time of happiness.</p>
<p>The door opened and his son stood there, fat and
squat and awkward in his priest‚Äôs clothes, and ill at
ease like a peasant, with red swollen peasant‚Äôs
hands and a round face covered with pimples. Only
the eyes were her eyes, great, brown, gentle, sensi-
tive e3res, like a doe‚Äôs, in which the shadow of pain
was mirrored so easily. He had wanted it dark so
that he could not see those eyes.</p>
<p>He tried to speak kindly, **Sit down, Fulco.
Where have you been?‚Äù</p>
<p>The man sat down. (He must be nearly forty-
one, thought Father d‚ÄôAstier.) His hands clasped
his hat. It was not the proper manner for a priest,
but rather the manner of a timid commercial
traveler trying to sell an article which no one
wanted. (He will never rise in the Church, thought</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>Father d‚ÄôAstier, because he does not understand the
world. He is too simple. )</p>
<p>Fuko spoke in a weak voice, rather too high-
pitched and a little grating. ‚ÄúI have been to the
Palazzo Gonfarini praying there. There was a
great crowd of devout. Surely the Holy Virgin has
vouchsafed a miracle in your own house.‚Äù</p>
<p>How round-eyed he was and how credulous, how
exactly like her! Father d‚ÄôAstier tried to be firm
and kind.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is true, Fuko, that the woman died in my
house, but that means nothing. You must not hope
for vain things, Fuko. Nothing is known of her.
People always come like that to seek relics the min-
ute anything strange occurs. People want to believe
in miracles, and among the poor, relics are valuable.
The poor can turn them into money.‚Äù</p>
<p>It was odd that he found himself speaking to this
man of forty as if he were a child. It was odd and
revolting.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe was a good woman, Father d‚ÄôAstier. A
reltgieuse. She came daily for years to worship the
pictures of Saint John the Shepherd. I have seen
her there day after day with my own eyes. The
very doves in the Piazza loved her, and the little
birds sat by her when she was dying. Sister Annun-
ziata swears to that. And the janitress. I saw
them too, but you need not take my word; there is
the word of the others.‚Äù</p>
<p>Father d‚ÄôAstier interrupted him. ‚ÄúThe janitress
is infidel and anti-clerical and Socialist. She is mali-
cious and intelligent. We cannot take her word.
Besides, saints are not made like that. We do not</p>
<p>iS6 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>even know that the woman had espoused the
Church.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe was a good woman,‚Äù persisted Fulco. ‚ÄúThe
light of God was in her eyes.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd how do you know the light of God?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI know, Father d‚ÄôAstier, I know. I have seen
it once before in the eyes of Sister Annunziata who
they are beginning to say is crazy. I know the light
of God.‚Äù</p>
<p>Fulco went a little breathlessly, for the climb up
the four flights of stairs to the top of the palace
had taken his breath. He kept telling Father d‚ÄôAs-
tier all those things about Miss Annie Spragg which
the older man had already found out for himself and
knew better than Fulco. The old priest did not lis-
ten. He sat with bowed head as if he were listen-
ing, but he was thinking of other things. He was
thinking of Brinoe forty years before when he had
come to stay with his mother‚Äôs people, not much
different from the Brinoe that lay all about him
tonight in the moonlight. The city was too old to
alter much. And he was thinking of the villa on
the hill beyond the Church of Monte Salvatore, a
small white villa surrounded by an orchard of olive
trees. And he was thinking of the fat widow of
Professor Baldessare and their daughter. The
Professor had been a remarkable man, raising him-
self from the level of the peasantry with a peasant
wife, greedy and coarse and vulgar. But the daugh-
ter was a miracle. He saw her again with a sicken-
ing clarity, like one of the women of Botticelli.
There was a room In the Uffizi that he had not en-
tered in years because he could not bear to look at</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>IS7</p>
<p>a picture that hung there. (Fulco was talking, talk-
ing. He became drunk with words without ever
knowing their value.) Laura was her name, like
Petrarch‚Äôs Laura. It was odd how long an old
wound could give pain.</p>
<p>He had been young then and strong, not this old
man tired of the world who sat listening to Fulco‚Äôs
complaints against his fellow priests ‚Äî ^young and
twenty-two, a boy who thought the world his for the
taking, a boy who sinned and then tormented him-
self with his sense of sin and then mocked at God
and the Church, only to begin again on the same
round in the order. He had been full of animal
delight at being alive, and the delight of delights
was Laura Baldessare. It was not the memory of
his sin with her that troubled him now, but of the
other sin he had committed, so much the worse, of
destrojnng her soul by tearing from it cruelly the
simple faith that had dwelt there. He had done it
with wild gusts of adolescent talk, and because she
loved him she had believed what he told her. She
believed anything he told her‚Äî he who stood in
awe of God at one moment and in the next felt
superior to God, a silly fellow strong enough to
doubt but too feeble to stand before the awesome
spectacle of a universe. He knew better now. He
was no longer defiant. He only waited for the end,
to see.</p>
<p>Fulco was questioning him. He raised his head
and murmured, ‚ÄúYes, Fulco, but continue. Tell me
all your reasons first.‚Äù Fulco was so certain that
the old maid was a saint.</p>
<p>He could not hear</p>
<p>what Fulco said for the</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>158</p>
<p>memories that crowded in upon him, memories
which went back years before there was ever a po-
tential saint in the Palazzo Gonfarini. In Fulco‚Äôs
eyes there was that same fire of belief that had once
burned in her eyes. It redeemed Fulco, he thought,
from being an utter lout. ‚ÄúThere is a demon born
In me,‚Äù he thought, ‚Äúthat has always tormented
those I have loved best.‚Äù Anna, too, he had tor-
mented, long afterward.</p>
<p>Again he began to think what his life would have
been if at Its beginning he had taken another tuim-
Ing. If he had married Laura. He could have mar-
ried her even at the end before she died when Fulco
was born, but chance had brought him too late, an
hour after she had died, going out Into the darkness
shaken and terrified because he had destroyed her
faith. That, he thought, was a real sin, a sin that
could torment one even into the grave. Fler poor
faith did no one any harm and it had made her un-
afraid.</p>
<p>And now for forty years he had been atoning for
that sin since the day when in the midst of youth
he had turned to the Church to atone. He had
kept his vow. He had atoned. From that day on
he had never known love, and for him that was not
an easy thing. But others had been made to atone
as well, for life was a silly tangled thing. There
was Anna driving through the darkness like a mad
woman to meet her lover because she had never
found love and still believed that one day she might
find it. That was her faith, a good faith, quite as
good perhaps as the other though more easily
proven false. She would not believe that already</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>m</p>
<p>it was too late. And what good had this atonement
brought to himself or to God or to the world?
What had it brought him in the end but old age and
doubt ? It had not made Laura alive again. It had
not restored her faith before she died, so that she
might die in peace.</p>
<p>And here was Fulco raving about faith and saints
and a peasant‚Äôs Heaven filled with pink and blue
plaster images and magenta paper wreaths. That
was the cruel joke Nature had played on him ‚Äî ^mak-
ing Fulco not in the image of Laura or himself, so
that he might have had a son to be proud of, but in
the image of that vulgar and scheming old woman,
Laura‚Äôs mother, who connived at her daughter‚Äôs sin
because she saw her one day as the Marquise d‚ÄôAs-
tier. That was Nature‚Äôs bitter jest, that and this
stupid adoration which Fulco had for the man he
did not even know was his father. If Fulco had not
been stupid he might have guessed long ago that
there was some reason for this stranger‚Äôs interest in
him. And Fulco had become a priest because he,
Father d‚ÄôAstier, was a priest. This fat, stupid, pim-
ply little man was his son, his heir, who should have
been the Marquis d‚ÄôAstier. Suddenly he felt a sick-
ening wave of distaste and hatred for his own son.
He was stupid, stupid, and he could never be rid of
him.</p>
<p>Then all at once he knew a fierce desire to beat his
head against the floor. ‚ÄúI am proud and worldly
like all the others. I have learned nothing at all.
I am no different. O God, teach me humility.‚Äù</p>
<p>Fulco‚Äôs thin monotonous voice trickled through</p>
<p>i6o THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>the haze of memories. ‚ÄúSister Annunziata is a
woman inspired of God. . ,</p>
<p>He could bear it no longer. He raised his head
this time and looked straight into those trusting
doe-like eyes. A kind of madness seized him.
There was something in those eyes which he must
destroy. He knew he must quench It forever. He
could have no peace until he had done it.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou are stupid, Fulco. You are stupid. You
have lived in the world for forty years and have
learned nothing. . . . Nothing. You complain be-
cause they do not give you a parish. Parishes are
not gotten by faith alone. Men are not made
princes of the Church simply because they have
faith. You learn nothing. The Church has no need
of a saint now, least of all in Brinoe. There is noth-
ing to show that this woman has ever embraced the
faith. Miracles cannot happen to heretics. There
is no place for your simplicity in the Church. For
centuries there has been no place for it.‚Äù</p>
<p>In the eyes of the fat little man the shadow of
pain and terror was mirrored. He sat on the edge
of the chair, his fat red hands crushing the black
hat. The sight of him sitting thus, so stupid and
humble, only enraged Father d‚ÄôAstler. He thought
wildly, ‚ÄúHe has neither courage nor intelligence.‚Äù</p>
<p>Aloud he said, ‚ÄúYou have lived too long among
priests, Fulco, and superstitious peasants. Can you
not see that the Church is no longer a power? It Is
only a shelter for the weak and fearful, all those
who must have miracles and wondrous things, like
children in the presence of a cheap magician.‚Äù</p>
<p>He arose suddenly, as if possessed, and began to</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>i6i</p>
<p>pace the narrow room. The demon had risen now,
alive and fearful. He told Fulco things which had
long been hidden in his heart which he had told to
no one since the day he entered the Church. The
heretic churches were no better, he cried, because
they tried to mingle faith with reason and that could
not be done. All that the Church taught was a
legend and a superstition. To believe, one had to
be as simple as the most ignorant man. To believe,
one must be stupid and afraid. Had he not brought
souls to the Church? Had he not brought money
to the Church? It was for that he worked and that
alone. Did he not know these things ? Had he not
lived with the Church for nearly half a century?
Not because he believed, but because it was a pro-
fession, a career.</p>
<p>And this whole affair of the Spragg woman was
nonsense ‚Äî the concoction of a half-insane nun and a
malicious peasant woman who hated priests. And if
even such things could be, if they were true, the
Church would not make a saint of her, because it
had no need of saints at the moment. The same
miracle had happened to more than a hundred
others. It was on record. They were always hys-
terical women. No great organization could saint
every woman who saw fit to produce miraculous
scars on her body. The Church made saints when
it needed them and where it needed them. It was
not an affair left to the Divine Will of God. It
was geography and politics.</p>
<p>The Church was not rich and powerful because
it was the instrument of God, but because the men in
the Church had made it so. They were politicians.</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>162</p>
<p>Because men chose to enter the Church it did not
make them different from other men. They were,
after ail, pitiful and human and insignificant like all
the others. They made people believe in things
which no man could prove. The Church had mud-
dled and compromised and corrupted the teachings
of Jesus. It had buried his teachings beneath a
mountain of cant and theology and superstition.
When it was powerful it had committed murder by
fire and torture always in the name of God but al-
ways to increase its own power and wealth and
stamp out its enemies. It was among the great crim-
inals of the world.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGo to your history, Fulco,‚Äù he cried out.
‚ÄúCease being a dolt. Read the records of its world-
liness. It lives by gold more than by faith, taking
the money of those who are afraid or who bargain
with it. I know. I have brought it much money.
It is my work to bring the rich and the powerful into
the Church.‚Äù</p>
<p>He halted suddenly, facing the frightened Fulco.
‚ÄúAnd your faith. What is it? It has been said
that faith can move mountains, but no one has seen
it done, save by the faith that man has in himself,
in the steam shovels and the dymamite he has in-
vented in the face of a hostile Nature. Man can
save himself by faith, but not by a cowardly faith
that pins itself upon conjurer‚Äôs tricks, but by faith
in himself and in Nature and in the teachings of
Christ. The world and the Church have forgotten
Christ, who was a simple man. What had Christ
to do with the cheap tricks of an old maid, an in-</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 163</p>
<p>sane nun and a malicious scrubwoman? All that
should be beneath the dignity of God‚Äôs church.‚Äù</p>
<p>He moved to the table and took up the thin book
which held for him all the peace he knew. He
opened easily to a page to which he had turned a
thousand times in the struggle to subdue the mon-
ster in his soul. By the yellow light of the candle he
began to read.</p>
<p>‚Äò‚ÄòFor a man‚Äôs worthiness is not to be estimated
by the number of visions and comforts which he may
have, or by his skill in the Scriptures or by his being
placed in a higher station:</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut by his being grounded in humility, and full
of divine charity; if he be always purely and sin-
cerely seeking Gods honor; if he think, nothing of
and unfeignedly despise himself, and even rejoice
more to be despised and little esteemed by others
than to be honored by them.‚Äù</p>
<p>H^e put down the book and turned his white face
toward Fulco. ‚ÄúWhere is humility in the world
today? Where is divine charity? Who is it that
purely and sincerely seeks God‚Äôs honor?‚Äù</p>
<p>Then, quite suddenly, he felt weak and leaned
against the window, his head in his hands, trembling.
xiG was an old, tired man once more.</p>
<p>iHere was a long silence and then the timid voice
of hulco mm-muring, ‚ÄúThe world, the Church can</p>
<p>be purified. If what you say is true. It can be
punned.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd who is to do it? The Church would have
none of Savonarola. The Jesuits turned into poli-
pcians who said the end justified the means. It
banged Savonarola by the neck and burnt his body</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>164</p>
<p>when he sought to purify the Church,‚Äù He turned
and looked at the cowering Fulco. ‚Äò‚ÄòGo now. I
can‚Äôt talk any longer.‚Äù</p>
<p>Fulco answered him. He was weeping like a
little child. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt argue these things. I know too
little. But the world can be saved,‚Äù he repeated.
‚ÄúThe Church can be purified.‚Äù</p>
<p>To Father d‚ÄôAstier it seemed impossible to re-
main any longer in the same room with this man
who was his son. Turning, he w^ent quickly into the
bedroom and, closing the door, bolted it, . . . The
room was tiny with only a narrow iron bed covered
with coarse blankets. Upon this he flung himself
down, feeling that he was ready to die. Fulco knew
now. Fulco, his own son, was the only one who
knew the truth. He had killed Fulco‚Äôs faith as he
had slaughtered the faith of Fulco‚Äôs mother. The
demon had won a second time. And faith was all
that poor Fulco had in the world.</p>
<p>Presently he sat up ‚Äò-an the narrow bed. ‚ÄúTomor-
row%‚Äù he thought bitterly, ‚ÄúI shall go out into the
world again and go to dinners and make flattering
speeches to rogues and criminals and fools. It is
too late now to change. I am too old. And to-
morrow no one will know.‚Äù Again he had betrayed
the thing he served.</p>
<p>Tomorrow he w^ould go again to the Villa Leon-
ardo to continue the conversion of that silly woman
Mrs. Weatherby, and from her he would get money
for the Church. Oh, he had brought money to the
Church ‚Äî thousands, millions of lira and francs and
marks and dollars and pounds. He had, he thought,
bought himself a place in Heaven by now. He had</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>i6s</p>
<p>the right to ask a seat of God. He would tell God
he had bought a seat in Heaven and paid for it. He
would go again to dinners and to house parties and
great receptions. &hellip;</p>
<p>In the midst of these thoughts he seemed to hear
the voice of someone talking quite near at hand. He
listened and presently he recognized the voice. It
was Fulco‚Äôs. He had not gone away after all. He
had been in the next room all the while, and now he
was down on his fat knees, praying to God for the
soul of Father d‚ÄôAstier.</p>
<p>STAY ME WITH FLAGONS</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>T he citizens of Winnebago Falls came long be-
fore she died to think of Mary Bosanky
simply and primitively as a town character, placing
her in the category of those who were a little less
than human. Most of them thought of her until
her death simply as a drunken old Irishwoman who
worked a little when she was sober, who went along
the streets muttering to herself and who died in the
end at the county poorhouse. But none of them
had seen her as she stepped ashore from a sailing
ship at New Orleans in the year of the Great Irish
Famine. Then she was twenty-six, buxom, strong
as a man, and handsome with black hair and blue
eyes and a fine high color. She could neither read
nor write but she boasted when drunk that she was
descended from the Kings of Clare. Toward the
end it was a boast that she used more and more fre-</p>

<p>quently, in the fashion of those who invoke blue
blood to compensate for the disappointments of this
life. And with Mary Bosanky there was great need
for compensation. There was the worthlessness of
Michael Bosanky and the poverty of the shack in
which they lived by the railroad, and most of all
there W&rsquo;as Shamus, her son, who was so beautiful to
look upon and so different from other sons. She
knew that all the blood of all the kings of Ireland
could not brighten the wits of Shamus.</p>
<p>And all her life she had as well to bear the cross
of her own stormy nature, which was that of one
who never found life quite fine enough to satisfy her
desires. In the beginning when she was young and
had her strength and vitality she managed somehow
to wrest from life a little of what she asked of it,
or at least she was young enough then to delude her-
self into believing that she had. She found a strange
excitement in everything ‚Äî in the wharves and the
river boats, the negroes and the markets of New
Orleans and then for a little time on the river boat
where she worked for the wife of the captain. She
had a kind of rollicking good nature that was al-
ways hungry for adventure, and when adventure did
not come she grew bored, and when she grew bored
she imagined grievances which convinced herself
that she was a creature abused and exploited, and
this in turn gave her a reason for quitting the place
where she worked and moving on to a new towni or
a new country. Before she was thirty she had been
a chambermaid, a cook, a dishwasher in a Cincinnati
saloon. She had cared for children and even worked
in the fields at harvest time. She lived almost the</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 167</p>
<p>life of a man, save that she was always virtuous be-
cause rooted deep in her savage and superstitious
nature there was a fear of priests and of the life
after death. She was terrified of thunderstorms
and of corpses and heard strange noises in the night.
There were no even, monotonous plains of content-
ment in her life. Her mood was either one in which
she went all day singing ballads from her home
county or one in which she went about praying and
moaning and saying her rosary. At the age of
twenty-eight she found herself washing dishes in
Rafferty‚Äôs saloon and lunch-room on the edge of
Winnebago Falls where the tracks of the Iowa,
Nebraska and Western Railroad crossed those of
the Trans-Mississippi Freight and Passenger Com-
pany. In those days they were building railroads
everywhere and it was always the Irish who did the
work, so Rafferty‚Äôs saloon was filled a large part of
the time with wild Irishmen drinking and carousing
in the hours when they were not shoveling earth
and stone to bring prosperity to sleepy places like
Winnebago Falls.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>Among the Irishmen was one Michael Bosanky,
a great red-haired giant of a fellow two years older
than Mary, who drank and roared and sought to
make life constantly more exciting than it could
possibly be. He was a devil with the ladies and he
tried to be a devil with Mary, but she would have
none of him save on the terms that the priests held
holy and respectable, and in the end the banns were</p>
<p>i68</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>published and they were marriedj drawn together
by an attraction which had its roots in that mutual
hunger for a life that was better than any life can be.</p>
<p>It was the beginning of Mary‚Äôs real trouble, be-
cause she was tied to Michael by a force stronger
than banns and marriage ties, stronger than her fear
of priests and of Hell. It was a force that would
not let her quit her job and go on to the next town.
She was in love with Michael in her own passionate
and possessive way and it was a love as violent as
the very natures of herself and Michael. She could
not imagine living without him. The sight of his
great brawny figure reeling across the tracks from
Rafferty‚Äôs saloon gave her a kind of fine palpitating
excitement she had never discovered in all her ad-
ventures. And it was thrilling to live with Michael
because he was roaring drunk a great part of the
time and he threw things at her and tried to beat
her. But she was a strong woman and the at-
tempted beating often turned Into a bravri that
ended in the wildest of love-making. She discovered
almost at once that Michael was no good, but that
did not vanquish the certainty that life with him
was a fine and glorious affair.</p>
<p>He lost one job after another and presently Mary
went back to working out, not this time at a regular
job, but by the day, sometimes cooking, sometimes
washing, sometimes scrubbing floors. She made a
little money this way, but Michael always took it
from her and went across the tracks to Rafferty‚Äôs
place. All of Winnebago Falls came to know Mary
Bosanky, She worked for the best families like the
Weatherbys and the Fosdicks. They grew fond of</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 169</p>
<p>her and they pitied her hard life, but it never oc-
curred to Mary to pity herself. Michael never
chased after other women any longer. He seemed
to find her enough for him.</p>
<p>And presently when Mary became a little weary
of Michael‚Äôs perpetual drunkenness she began, too,
to drink and life at once became brighter. They
drank together and the fights they had were magnifi-
cent. Sometimes one emerged with a blackened eye
and sometimes the other and sometimes both. She
began to grow undependable among the best
families of Winnebago Falls and so to lose her
work.</p>
<p>When she was thirty-nine something happened
which Mary regarded as a miracle. For nine years
she had prayed to all the saints of fertility and now
at thirty-nine she was going to have a baby. On the
advice of the priest she even gave up drinking,
which was for Mary a great sacrifice. The child
v/as born in the two-room shack by the railroad.
It was a pretty baby, a boy, curiously strong and
healthy, with black hair and blue eyes like herself.
He W&rsquo;as strong enough even to survive the rough
treatment that was certain to meet any child born
into the world of Bosanky‚Äôs Shanty. She called him
Sharaus after her father from whom she had not
heard in fifteen years. As he grew older he was
slow in walking and in making himself understood.</p>
<p>But when Shamus was old enough to go to the
parish school it was clear that there was something
wrong with him. He did not learn things like other
children and he could remember nothing of his les-
sons. He was not an idiot. It was more as if there</p>
<p>170 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>were a part of his brain that had never existed. The
other children tormented him and so he came to
play, alone and to invent extraordinary games.
At home his. only playground was. the railroad&ndash;
tracks and there he found his way miraculously
in and out among the locomotives and shimtlng
trains. . At^ nine he was still among the six-year-oid
children in the parish school. At ten he ran away^
four times within a month. Once he was missing
for two days and Marj?&rdquo; Bosanky, who loved the
child with the love which mothers have for children
who are different, wandered over the whole country-
side searching for him. He was discovered at last
on Ed Hasseiman‚Äôs farm by Maria Hazlett, Hassel-
man‚Äôs housekeeper, asleep in a thicket in the midst
of a flock of sheep. After that they gave up trying
to teach him anything and he was allowed to run
wild. When he was thirteen he began to have
visions. He would fall down in a kind of trance and
i*emam unconscious for hours and when he awak-
ened he told wonderful stories of having been to
Heaven and seen the golden streets and the angels
walking about. He heard wonderful music and his
great friend was Saint John the Shepherd.</p>
<p>in</p>
<p>Since neither Shamus nor drinking made life seem
grand enough, Mary and Michael came to discover
new ways of elevating their spirits. One way was
their expeditions to a place called Lakeville, which
was a sort of cheap summer resort for the Germans
of Winnebago Falls. There was at Lakeville a</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 171</p>
<p>round deep lake of cold clear blue water where the
fishing was good. On its banks there was a grove
of trees with cottages that were little more than
shacks set in their shade. Mary and Michael
seemed to know without planning it -when the time
had come to go to Lakeville for a carouse. To-
gether they would set out on foot to &ldquo;walk the four-
teen miles along the county road to the north past
Ed Hasselman‚Äôs fai*m and Meeker‚Äôs Gulch. A
friend of Mike‚Äôs, the foreman of the road gang, had
a shack there where they could stay. They always
took plenty of whiskey with them and left Shamus
behind in the shanty. Sometimes they would sleep
out of doors on a sand-bar under the moon and
sometimes in a rowboat made fast among the lily
pads and the tall shaking reeds near the shore. And
always there was wild drinking and wilder love-
making, as if Mary were still a handsome young girl
instead of a middle-aged woman bloated and saddled
by drink.</p>
<p>And Shamus, left to himself, took to wandering
more and more often, and farther and farther. He
never slept under a roof. Sometimes if the weather
was warm he slept in a thicket or a ditch and if it
w&rsquo;as cool, among the sheep or among the cattle in
the open sheds built in the fields to shelter the beasts
from the winter blizzards. The farmers of three
counties came to know him and to feed him when
he came their way. He was harmless and sometimes
he would help them in the fields without asking any
pay. He invented games for the children and made
them whistles from the willows that grew along the
streams and marshes. He did not make them sim-</p>
<p>THE STRANGE , CASE : OF</p>
<p>172</p>
<p>pie primitive whistles but whole sets of pipes bound
together with willow bark on which they could play
tunes. He was skilful with his hands and gentle in
working about beasts. At sixteen he w^as strong as
a man and possessed of a strange dark beauty not to
be found among the blond heavy German farmers.
He went about in rags, his clothing torn by briars and
barbed wire fences. Sometimes a farmer‚Äôs wife gave
him a shirt or an old pair of overalls. He had a
dark skin with a fine high color, black curling hair,
blue eyes and small ears that w- ere pointed at the tips.
He knew about Weather and could tell the farmers
when it would be safe to cut their hay and take in
their wheat. There was really nothing very strange
about him but the curious vacant look in his eyes,
his strange love for beasts and his way of not seem-
ing at times to understand when people spoke to
him.</p>
<p>The year that he w^as sixteen his mother came
back alone one morning from Lakeville and tried to
explain to Shamus that his father was dead. He
had fallen overboard from a rowboat and been
drowned. At least that was what people thought.
It was what Mary thought, for she didn‚Äôt i*eally
know what had happened. She had awakened sober
to find herself alone in the boat in the middle of the
lake. Michael had disappeared. They made an
effort to drag the lake but no trace was ever found
of Shamus‚Äôs father. There was a legend that the
lake had no bottom; at least no one had been able
to reach the bottom with a sounding line.</p>
<p>For a time Mary, sobered a little, gave up drink-
ing and went again to working regularly. She be-</p>
<p>‚ñ† . MISS ANNIE SPRAGG .. . &rsquo; 173</p>
<p>gan too to find a compensation for Shamus‚Äôs dull
wits ill the miracuions visions which he had. These
were more frequent now and more complete in their
details. &rsquo; She fancied that God had made her the
mother of a saint. The stones of his visions went
the round of the parish and all the county. But
Shamus did not abandon his habit of wandering off
into the open country for days at a time. When he
was gone Mary fcupxd life insupportable and took
again to the bottle.</p>
<p>They had been town characters for years when
the Reverend Uriah Spragg and his sister Annie
came to live in Winnebago Falls and old Mrs, Bo-
sanky, w‚Äôhen she ^vas sober enough, went to work for
Annie Spragg. Shamus Bosanky and his mother
were the only people in the town poorer than Uriah
and Annie Spragg and Annie Spragg was the only
person in the place who would any longer give Mary
Bosanky w^ork to do.</p>
<p>Sometimes Shamus w^ent with his mother to the
weathered wooden house hidden by lilacs, syringas
and burdock where the Spraggs lived. Miss Annie
Spragg fed them and was kind to them and presently
they came to be her only friends in Winnebago Falls.
She showed Shamus all the animals and birds that
lived in the wooden enclosure behind the house and
after a time it was as if he became one of them. He
would come day after day to spend his time there,
playing with them and teaching them tricks.</p>
<p>174</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>The rest of the tale comes from Ed Flasselman
and Maria Hazlett who kept house for him on the
farm near Meeker‚Äôs Gulch. Their part of it hap-
pened long after Uriah Spragg was murdered and
Annie, questioned and tormented, had been allowed
to disappear.</p>
<p>Since Shamus had first run off as a little boy he
had been friendly with Ed Hasselman and Maria
Hazlett. They always fed him and took no notice
of his goings and comings, and from the first they
seemed to accept him without question. Sometimes
he stayed about the farm for days sleeping among
the animals and helping in the fields. He was a
great help to Maria Hazlett at the periods when
Ed retired into drunkenness. At the time he told
them the story he was thirty-four years old. It was
only a little time before his death.</p>
<p>It was at the beginning of one of Ed Hasselman‚Äôs
spells and Shamus appeared one evening just at
dusk out of the woods back of the house. They had
finished supper and the milking was over and Maria
was washing the cream separator and the milk crocks
outside the kitchen door under the great catalpa
tree that grew there. As the sun had gone down a
great burning harvest moon came heavily up out of
the prairie and Ed on the doorstep with a flagon of
hard cider beside him sat playing on his concertina
snatches of half forgotten tunes that he had heard
as a child in Dorfsweiler, his father‚Äôs village of the
Black Forest. Maria got Shamus some cold ham
and some hard cider and bread and cheese and he</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG i7S</p>
<p>sat eating and listening shyly on the edge of the
stone coping about the spring.</p>
<p>He finished his supper and as it grew darker he
got up presently and began to dance, not any set
dance, but a series of steps which he had made up
himself. It was a dance composed mostly of mad
leapings and caperings so violent that remains of his
ragged clothes fell apart leaving him naked to the
waist under the hot August moon. Ed Hasselman
drinking more and more, gave Shamus more and
more to drink and played the concertina nioi-e and
more wildly while Shamus danced with his black
curling hair flying about his dark face. And all the
while Maria, her work finished, sat on a milking
stool watching the whole scene with a face on which
there showed neither astonishment nor interest.
She accepted the scene just as she had appeared to
accept everything since she had left the poorhouse
as an orphan and gone out into the world. Thus
she had accepted the long trial of Ed Hasselman‚Äôs
drunkenness and the discovery years earlier of the
body of Uriah Spragg in the ditch by the county
road.</p>
<p>x\t length Ed Hasselman became too drunk to
play and Shamus grew weary of his dancing and the
two of them sat quietly drinking and looking at the
moon. And presently Shamus told them the story
which no one in Winnebago Falls ever believed be-
cause they said that Shamus was a half-wit and that
Ed Hasselman was drunk. But Maria Hazlett was
not drunk. She never drank. She simply sat there
listening quietly. She was content with her world
as she found it.</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>176</p>
<p>It had happened years earlier before Uriah
Spragg was murdered and when he still lived with
his sister in the wooden house by the town dump.
Shamus was about twenty years old at the time and
he had been off wandering for days and was on his
way home because he felt one of his visions coming
on. It was dark and he had been hurrying across
fields and through woods for hours when he reached
Meeker‚Äôs Gulch. It was a lonely marshy place over-
grown with sumach and wfitch-hazei so dense that
even stray hunters rarely penetrated it. But Sha-
mus wasn‚Äôt afraid of it. In the depths of the wild
swamp he felt at home. It was only people who
frightened him.</p>
<p>It was, too, a hot still night like the night he
sat telling the story under the catalpas to Ed Has-
selman and Maria Hazlett, wdth a red hea&rsquo;v^‚Äô* August
moon climbing the prairie sky. There was not
a breath of air stirring, yet as Shamus pene-
trated the swamp he noticed an odd thing ‚Äî thzt all
the leaves of the sumach and witch-hazel, the oaks
and the cottonwoods, were dancing with a gentle
motion as if stirred by a gentle breeze. They kept
up a faint whispering and presently he was aware of
a faint prefume like that of wild honeysuckle and
he began to hear snatches of faint music which
seemed to come out of the very sticks and stones
and the trunks of the trees. It was sweet low music
like the sound of the fifes in the Grand Army parade
on the Fourth of July, only It was softer and less
shidlL He thought one of his visions was coming
on and so he hurried, pushing his way through the
thicket with such violence that most of his clothes</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>177</p>
<p>were torn from his body. He was looking for some
open grassy space where he might fall down and lie
for hours in a state of unconsciousness.</p>
<p>Then as he pushed through the witch-hazel he
came suddenly upon an open space where the thick
marsh grass had been trampled down in a wide cir-
cle and in the moonlight he discovered two dancing
figures, one very white and the other as black as the
shadows cast by the copper moon. One was Miss
Annie Spragg and the other was the black he-goat.
She w&rsquo;as quite naked with her long red hair falling
to her knees. There was a wreath of honeysuckle
on her head. The black he-goat capering prettily
with his delicate black front hoofs raised in the air
followed her round and round the trampled circle.
For a little time Shamus stood watching them‚Äô from
behind the trunk of a great oak tree and presently,
as if he could not help himself, he joined In the
dance.</p>
<p>It was sunset of the following day v^^hen he came
to his senses and found himself lying on the bruised
grass in the middle of Meeker‚Äôs Gulch,</p>
<p>When he had finished his story he slipped quietly
to the grass and fell into a sleep beneath the catalpa
trees. Maria Hazlett rose and covered him with a
featherbed and then i-aising the half-conscious Ed
Hasselman got him into bed. In the morning she
had to deliver the milk on the milk route in W^inne-
bago Palls, because Ed was taken again by one of
his spelis.</p>
<p>178</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>‚ñ† V ‚ñ†</p>
<p>It was t‚Äôwo years after this almost to the day
W‚Äô^hen Shamus wtnt off for the last time wandering
across the country. Flis mother had been sleeping
quietly in the shanty by the railroad-tracks when
she was awakened In the middle of the night by the
thunder that terrified her. Rising, she began to
sprinkle holy w&rsquo;ater about the shanty and to call
upon the saints to protect her. When she went into
the kitchen where Shamus slept she found his bed
empty. Despite her terror of the storm, she w^&lsquo;ent^
outside and called his name again and again into
the screaming prairie wind. But she got no answ^er.
In the flashes of lightning she found no trace of
Shamus but only thick black shadows and the dis-
tant lights of the railroad switches. He was gone
into the wild storm and she could not find him.</p>
<p>When the sun came up the next morning he did
not return and she went to the police, who laughed
at her craziness, not knowing w^hat Shamus was to
her. They telephoned about the county but no one
had seen any trace of him. It was Maria Hazlett
who thought where he might be found. That eve-
ning Vy&rsquo;hen she went to fetch the cows from the pas-
ture by MeekeRs Gulch she went into the swamp and
there in the thickest part she found him. He y/as
lying on the thick grass, which had been trampled
dowm in a wide circle. He lay on his back in the
shadow of the big oak with one arm thrown over
his head. His clothes were all torn and the rain
had plastered them close to his supple body. His
black hair lay in ringlets over the dark forehead.</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>179</p>
<p>She thought he was asleep at first or in one of his
trances, but he was dead. There was no mark of
any kind on his body.</p>
<p>She picked him up and managed to carry him to
the edge of the swamp, where she laid his body on
the grass beside the brook until Ed Hasselman could
come and help her get it back to the house. Dead,
he seemed to her more beautiful than ever. It was
odd, she told Ed Hasselman, that he had never ap-
peared to grow any older. He must have been
thirty-eight when he died but he looked no older
than he had looked at twenty. Perhaps, she said,
it was because he was half-witted. People like that
didn‚Äôt seem to grow old. They belonged to a world
of their own.</p>
<p>VI</p>
<p>The church burled him in consecrated ground, so
Mary‚Äôs soul was at peace. After that she was never
sober again and at last they took her out of the filth
and squalor of the little shack, off to the poorhouse.
One morning three weeks after they brought her
there the keeper found her dead in bed. She was
seventy-seven years old, a queer dried-up wisp
of a woman who had once been the fine high-colored
Mary Bosanky. In all those seventy-seven years
life had never once been fine enough for her.</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>i8o</p>
<p>THE END OF AUNT BESSIE</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Q HE was not a bad girl, not really. It simply
never occurred to her that there was anything
wrong, not very wrong, in the way she lived. And
so she often remarked to Teena Bitts, ‚ÄúFra not a
tart proper, I never went off with a man that I didn‚Äôt
meet proper in Winterbottom‚Äôs place.‚Äù The pave-
ment knew her not although she was well known to
the patrons of the Pot and Pie, a sort of restaurant
and public house and rendezvous of bookmakers on
the city side of Bayswater. She had been ruined
at sixteen in an areaway while her mother was away
scrubbing the stairs of the Houses of Parliament,
and when the same mother discovered Bessie‚Äôs error
and its impending result, she sought out the man
and made him right the wrong. Technically Bessie‚Äôs
child (which died) had a father, but substantially
Bessie had no husband, for he disappeared two days
after the ceremony and was never heard of again.</p>
<p>But marriage did not make of Bessie an honest
woman. She went her way as before and in a few
months Mrs. Cudllp, her mother, reported to her
charring friends that Bessie‚Äôs husband had returned
and that Bessie had lost her position at the Pot and
Pie. In four months Bessie gave birth to what her
mother called ‚Äúa little girl,‚Äù and Bessie went back
to work leaving the baby to be cared for by a child-
less couple who lived in Hammersmith and later
adopted it. Before Bessie was twenty-four the same</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG l8l</p>
<p>incident in all its details (even to the return of the
husband who appeared to visit Bessie after the mys-
terious fashion prevalent among the heathen gods)
was repeated twice more. At the birth of the third
child, Bessie very nearly died and after that she ap-
peared to change her ways. At least the husband
did not miraculously reappear and she had no more
children.</p>
<p>At twenty-eight she was a plump, coarsely pretty
girl, whose high spirits never deserted her. With
a loud laugh she could bandy the coarsest jests with
any of the coarse patrons of the Pot and Pie. Her
round rosy face, her blue eyes, and the blond hair
that hung damp and curling from a huge pompa-
dour constructed over an elaborate apparatus of
wire, were among the stimuli which betrayed sober
men suddenly into the pagan knowledge that it was
best to live while one was alive. Without dreaming
of such a thing she conveyed this message to every
man she served with mutton pie and stout. And
Bessie was so carefree and good-natured that she
never imposed upon her admirers any sense of sin.
It was all a lark. She even came to be known in a
strange blend of good humor, affection and contempt
bred of familiarity as Our Bess and sometimes
Good Queen Bess. She was the toast and the joy
of the Pot and Pie and the men who came in with
pockets empty and spirits depressed went away after
a tilt with Our Bess feeling warmed and cheered.
She really loved humanity. She loved the smoke
and heat of the tap room, the collared looks of the
mugs of ale, the oaths of the cabbies and book-
makers and the sight of old Mrs. Crumyss, ^nny</p>
<p>i 82</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>and happy, exchanging crackling witticisms with the
gentlemen who baited her. She had, too, a liking,
fatal to one of her tendency to plumpness, a great
liking for the ale that came out of the shiny brass-
bound tuns served by Teena Bitts. ‚ÄúThat Mrs.
Crumyss,‚Äù she used to say in relating to her mother
choice bits of that lady‚Äôs wit, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a hot ‚Äôun.‚Äù She
had a way of emphasizing such remarks by a hearty
slap on her round, well-covered thigh. There was
ail the zest about Our Bess that Rubens, who
loved life, imparted to the plump rosy ladies who
were so like her. Winterbottom, the proprietor of
the Pot and Pie, understood her value to him. He
did not even object to her enforced holidays.</p>
<p>But Bessie never had any money. It was not that
she spent it, even in betting on the races, as might
have been supposed. She had a ‚Äôerror of betting
and of bookmakers as bookmakers. She never had
any money because she never understood how it was
people got money. Even Winterbottom underpaid
her. Sometimes her ‚Äúfriends‚Äù gave her a cheap
trinket or a pair of silk stockings or a few shillings
but rarely more than that. Teena Bitts said scorn-
fully that she had no character. But Our Bess only
laughed and asked Teena what her character had
got her beyond a reputation for being coldblooded
and stingy.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>The development of character in Our Bess ‚Äî that
change which turned her in the end into Aunt Bessie
of Bloomsbury and St. John‚Äôs Chapel ‚Äî dated from
the twenty-fourth of December, 1905, a cold foggy</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 183</p>
<p>night with snow falling that melted as it fell. She
had been standing in the doorway watching Teena
Bitts draw ale from the fine brass-bound tuns and
listening with hearty appreciation to the sallies of
old Mrs. Crumyss, who was trying to drink through
her veil, when the door opened and in out of the fog
came a small thin man with a pinched face as white
as wax. He had no overcoat and the collar of his
coat was turned up about his thin throat. None of
the others appeared to take any notice but the sight
of him did something to Bessie. Perhaps it was
pity that struck her down, for he was everything that
she W‚Äôas not. He was sickly, white and shivering,
with a wild look in his near-sighted brown eyes.
She marked him at once for her own, filled with a
strange emotion that sometimes took possession of
her. To herself she called it, ‚Äúfeeling that she
ought to brighten ‚Äôim up a bit,‚Äù but it was really
much more primitive and direct than that. Bessie
felt sorry for anyone who could not see that the
world was a fine and shining place, as fine indeed
as the brass bands on Winterbottom‚Äôs ale barrels.
She could not see why everyone should not be as
happy as herself.</p>
<p>He did not respond to her sallies as other men
did. Even after she had served him with meat pie,
a pitcher of stout, a gooseberry tart and some
coffee, his spirits failed to show any signs of rising.
Nothing, she discovered, seemed to have any effect
upon him. He failed even to appreciate the excruci-
ating sallies of Mrs. Crumyss. After he had eaten
he began to drink brandies and sodas, drinks with a
great deal of brandy and very little soda. The</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>184</p>
<p>more depressed he became the more interested and
curious became Bessie‚Äôs attitude. It was like a chal-
lenge to her, as if her record was to be smirched with
failure for the first time in the eyes of Winterbottom
and Teena Bitts and the others. She noticed that
despite the shabbiness of his clothes he was clean,
and that his hands were white and soft. And then
suddenly she discovered that under his coat he had
no shirt but only a frayed undershirt and she had
doubts that he would be able to pay for all he was
drinking. But remembering that it was Christmas
Eve she told herself that if Winterbottom made
trouble she‚Äôd pay the bill out of her own money.
Everyone else in the place was so gay and happy.
Mrs. Crurayss was never in better form. She was
still drinking through her veil and seemed now to be
managing quite well, as if, like the seventh child of
a seventh child, she had been born with one.</p>
<p>A little before closing time when the noise was at
its height the stranger suddenly fell forward on the
table and Bessie, feeling that the time had come to
act, pointed out to him that the pub was closing and
that he had better pay for all he had eaten and
drunk. Her suggestion brought forth no response
save a mumbling and moaning sound of which she
could make nothing. Winterbottom at last noticed
her efforts and knowing her fatal sympathy for any
customer who could not pay, came over to the table.
He went straight to the point, searching the
stranger‚Äôs pockets hopefully, but he found only a
half-penny, a soiled handkerchief and three damp
woodbines. He had already started for the door to</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 185</p>
<p>summon a policeman when Bessie stopped him.
‚ÄúLeave ‚Äôim alone,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pay for it.‚Äù</p>
<p>Winterbottom was content. It had happened be-
fore. He would rather have the money than see the
stranger arrested, even if the money came out of
Bessie‚Äôs pocket.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd what are you going to do when It closes?‚Äù
he asked her.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNever you fret about that. I‚Äôll take ‚Äôim in
charge.‚Äù</p>
<p>The revellers, singing, went out at last. Teena
Bitts put on her hat and went off scornfully to
spend a respectable Christmas with her parents in
Limehouse, and Winterbottom stood waiting to see
what Bessie proposed to do. In a moment she came
in from the washroom and gave the cynical Winter-
bottom a challenging glance. She was looking high-
colored and high-spirited as if she felt her reputation
menaced a second time In the same evening. She
was a strong woman, and after raising the stranger
to his feet she took him firmly by one arm and set
out through the fog. Winterbottom put up the
shutters, locked the door and put out the lights,
unaware that he had lost Our Bess forever.</p>
<p>Somehow, through fog and snow, through
crooked and winding streets, she got the stranger
back to her own room. Toward the end it was a
little easier because he began to see things following
him and that hurried him along.</p>
<p>i86</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>The beginning of Bessie‚Äôs character was a violent
one, for she no sooner had the pitiful creature safe in
her warm and shabby room than he went entirely to
pieces. He began seeing things in her closet, under
the bed and coming through the transom above the
door. He saw all manner of strange beasts, even
to unicorns, which Bessie knew well enough did not
exist save on the splendid device of the British Em-
pire. Under the stimulus of delirium the little man
developed a superhuman strength which proved very
nearly too much even for the stalwart Bessie. But
she succeeded at last in binding him into the great
double bed, and after rousing another indignant lady
dwelling in the same house she secured morphine,
which after a time reduced him to a stupor. She
managed at last to get an hour‚Äôs sleep lying beside
him lest he should awake and become violent again.
In the early morning she gave him some hot milk
and when he fell asleep again she put on her hat and
coat and set out through the slush for the Pot and
Pie.</p>
<p>There she confronted Winterbottom and told him
that she was in need of a holiday. He looked at
her with a twinkle in his hard eye and asked,
‚ÄúWhat? Apin?‚Äù</p>
<p>But Bessie denied his suspicion. She had a
cousin, she said, who was ill and in need of care.
Otherwise he would be sent to the workhouse and
no Cudlip had ever darkened the door of a work-
house.</p>
<p>So Mrs. Winterbottom took Bessie‚Äôs place at the</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 187</p>
<p>Pot and Pie until Bessie was able to return. It had
long since become an accepted system.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>The stranger not only became Bessie‚Äôs problem;
he took on the proportions of a crusade. She
tended him carefully, rarely leajving his side save to
buy food out of her almost invisible savings or to
come down on the heads of others in the house who
disturbed his rest by becoming noisy. She had in a
cheap doctor and with the shrewdness of the poor
she learned from him enough so that it was unneces-
sary to have him a second time. Her patient, she
discovered, was suffering not only from drink but
from starvation. She fed him up in splendid style
and as he progressed toward recovery she experi-
enced a new emotion ‚Äî that of pride in the efficacy
of her cure. She even thought for a time of giving
up her way of life and becoming a nurse, but learn-
ing upon investigation that such a change implied
complications and a good deal of tiresome training,
she abandoned the idea.</p>
<p>It was not until the third week that she learned
the name of the stranger. He had been well enough
for some time to lie in bed watching her out of his
dark eyes, but Bessie, feeling that it was indelicate
to be curious about his name, did not mention the
matter. She simply continued to address him as
refer to him to the others in the house as
‚Äú ‚Äôim.‚Äù She stood in awe of hm, for her cockney
shrewdness told her that he had come out of a world
far above her, of which she knew nothing. The</p>
<p>i8S</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>delicate hands, the beautiful accent, the dim weak
face with dark eyes under a high white forehead,
filled her with a strange pride. This was indeed a
rare flower that had fallen into her hands. Even
as she lay beside him on the bed (there was nowhere
else for her to sleep) she felt that she was com-
mitting sacrilege.</p>
<p>At length one day he looked at her and said, ‚ÄúMy
name is Lionel Blundon. What‚Äôs yours?‚Äù</p>
<p>She blushed and said, ‚ÄúBessie Cudlip.‚Äù It
sounded so cheap and commonplace beside the ele-
gance of Lionel Blundon. ‚ÄúLionel,‚Äù she said to
herself, ‚ÄúLionel.‚Äù That was an elegant name.</p>
<p>He began presently to sit up weakly in bed and to
take a faint interest in things.</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>But Bessie soon found that her funds were vanish-
ing. Funds were a thing that never mattered be-
fore. There was always the Pot and Pie or she
could borrow from Teena Bitts or get an advance
from Winterbottom. But it mattered now; Mr.
Blundon was a responsibility. He could not be sent
out into the streets, white and ill and shaking with
fever. He seemed content with his lot and dis-
played no inclination to go.</p>
<p>So one night after Mr. Blundon had gone to
sleep, she slipped out to the Pot and Pie dressed in
her best clothes. She took up a place in the corner
and became the center of interest. The place had
not been the same since she left and they now re-
ceived her with cheers. The men bought her drinks.</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 189</p>
<p>Even old Mrs. Crumyss was thrown into the shadow
by her triumphant return and spent the whole eve-
ning neglected in the corner, mumbling and drink-
ing. Teena Bitts, standing before her shining tuns,
grew sarcastic and made bitter inquiries about the
stranger whom Bessie had ‚Äúpicked from the dust
bin.‚Äù And Bessie, a little flushed and excited by her
triumph, retorted that he had turned out to be a
gentleman and the cousin of the Duke. But this
gave Mrs. Crumyss her long awaited opportunity.
From then on she kept making bitter remarks about
‚ÄúThe Duchess‚Äù and ‚Äú ‚Äôer Gryce,‚Äù and won back a
little of her prestige. The name stuck to Bessie.
Our Bess became ‚Äôer Gryce from that day forward.</p>
<p>At dosing time Mrs. Crumyss led the way with
unsteady dignity, followed one by one by the others,
and at last Bessie left too, accompanied by ‚ÄôArry,
who, rumor had it, had just made a killing on the
Newmarket. Teena, seeing her go, remarked that
it was the first time Bessie had shown any character.</p>
<p>At dawn she returned before Mr. Blundon was
awake and for several days she was in funds. Ne-
cessity had made her practical.</p>
<p>As Mr. Blundon (as she continued to call him)
grew stronger, he appeared also to grow restless.
Feeling that he was too proud and of a birth too
noble to accept money from her, she left small sums
about carelessly when she went out, sometimes on
the table, sometimes on a shelf in the closet, as if it
were crumbs for birds. Always when she returned
it was gone. By this trick he was able to buy him-
self cigarettes and newspapers. He did not return
to the Pot and Pie and showed no inclination to</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>190</p>
<p>drink so she came to the conclusion that his drink-
ing was not a disease but done deliberately out of
despair. Once in a burst of confidence he confided
to her that on the night he had come to the Pot and
Pie he had been contemplating suicide but that on
studying the chilly river he had decided instead to
drink himself to death. He was a simple fellow,
she thought, who didn‚Äôt pretend to be anything he
was not.</p>
<p>Then one day he asked her timidly if she would
do an errand for him. He wanted some books and
he was still too ill to go into the city for them him-
self. So Bessie dressed herself up and made the
excursion, bearing a slip of paper on which were
written the titles, because she could not possibly have
remembered them. They were difficult names
which impressed her profoundly, such names as
Astaroth and Indo-Persian and Anait. They
seemed very rare books, for she was forced to trudge
from shop to shop to find them all, and they were
very expensive. Later on she made other trips to
buy books until her room had quite the air of a
library. Then Mr. Blundon bought ink and pens
and paper and went to work. Each day he covered
a great many sheets of paper with spidery hand-
writing which she attempted without much success
to decipher when he was not in the room. But even
those portions which she was able to read (and she
was none too good at reading and writing) she failed
to understand, and she had not the presumption to
question him about the whole affair.</p>
<p>But all this took money (she had even to buy him
new clothes) and so Bessie went more and more</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 191</p>
<p>frequently to the Pot and Pie, always as a patron,
and only after Mr. Blundon had gone to bed. Al-
ways she came in early before he was awake. She
was afraid that he would discover the nature of her
excursions and forbid them. She took great care
not to disturb him on getting into bed, but once or
twice she fancied that he was awake when she came
in. When he made no reference to her mysterious
absences, she decided that she must have been w&rsquo;rong,
though she was quite certain that once at least he
had opened his eyes and looked at her. She even
managed to save up quite a bit of money. Teena
Bitts‚Äôs sarcastic references to ‚Äú ‚Äôer Gryce‚Äôs lack of
character‚Äù grew more and more mild and at length
died away altogether. Teena was outdone.</p>
<p>But Bessie had a plan that would require all her
money. Mr. Blundon had become to her more than
a crusade ; he was now a part of her life. If he
seemed tired, she began to worry. If he did not
eat she thought of calling a doctor. She could not
imagine her life without him. And when his poor
health lingered she decided that it was the air of
Bayswater and that what he needed was a holiday at
Brighton.</p>
<p>She was fearful that if she mentioned the plan,
his pride might cause him to object to it and so until
the day when she had saved enough to swing the ex-
cursion In style, she did not speak of it. When at
last she summoned up courage to propose it, Blun-
don accepted it at once as a splendid Idea. He
would take his books and work in the sea air.</p>
<p>But she could not resist having a final triumph at
the Pot and Pie and the night before they departed</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>192</p>
<p>she went there to let Teena Bitts and Winterbottom
and Mrs. Crumyss know in the most casual way pos-
sible that she and her friend were going to Brighton
for a spell. Winterbottom eyed her shrewdly and
sadly, suspecting that the moment had come when
he was to lose Our Bess forever, and after she had
gone Mrs. Crumyss remarked acidly through her
veil that ‚Äúthe next thing they‚Äôd be hearing was that
‚Äôer Gryce had become one of them swell divorce co-
respondents.‚Äù</p>
<p>VI</p>
<p>It was the first time Bessie had ever been outside
London and, as she said, ‚Äúit made her feel lost.‚Äù
Even the crowds and the music on the jetty did not
help much after she was used to them; they did not
make up for the gayety of the Pot and Pie with
Teena Bitts uttering coarse bitter comments and
‚ÄôArry and Alf drinking and Mrs. Crumyss giving
freely of her experience of life. Without Mr.
Blundon Bessie would have been miserable, but his
presence gave her a purpose, something, as it were,
to steer by. She had to plan the days and watch
over his health and see that there wasn‚Äôt any noise
in the lodging house and buy him cigarettes. Al-
though she had long been Bessie to him, she never
presumed to call him anything but Mr. Blundon, and
although they shared the same room there had never
been even a suspicion of lovemaking between them.</p>
<p>It was in the second week of the visit that the
great meeting occurred. Mr. Blundon, who was
working hard at the lodging house and was a bit
exhausted by Bessie‚Äôs hungry attempts at conversa-</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>193</p>
<p>tion, suggested that she go and listen to the band
concert, and as she always felt restless away from
crowds, she took his advice. He would meet her
by the fifth light out from the shore on the pier.</p>
<p>It was a soft fine evening and all Bessie‚Äôs smoul-
dering hunger for life was fanned into a flame. In-
deed her emotions had so thoroughly gotten the
better of her that she began to wish Mr. Blundon
wasn‚Äôt so sickly and that he wasn‚Äôt such a swell that
she was afraid of him. She began to feel deep
yearnings for the companionship of the Pot and Pie.
She even wished that Mr. Blundon might miracu-
lously turn out to be ‚ÄôArry or Alf. Lost in this
strange mood of depression she wandered along the
pier to the accompaniment of Pomp and Circum-
stance. She reached the fifth light and halted, lost
in a slough of homesickness. And then someone
pinched her and her spirits skyrocketed once more.</p>
<p>Turning, she planned to upbraid her insulter, since
that was the conventional thing to do. ‚ÄúHow dared
he do such a thing to a lady?‚Äù (Indeed she had
been acquiring airs lately through contact with Mr.
Blundon‚Äôs elegance. ) But when she turned there
was no possible suspect in sight but a kindly looking
old gentleman in black who wore a black Homburg
hat and carried a black umbrella. He looked a lit-
tle, she thought, like a parson. Thinking that the
pinch must have been administered by some mis-
chievous person who vanished in the crowd, she
turned back to her reverie. Being pinched was not
a new experience for Bessie. Her plumpness made
her a tempting subject and she had developed a tech-
nique for dealing with the situation. Barely had</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>194</p>
<p>her spirits fallen, leaving her to brood over the sea,
than the pinch was repeated.</p>
<p>Again she turned sharply and this time there could
be no mistake. It voas the kindly old gentleman in
the Homburg hat who had pinched her. She gave
him an indignant glance, but not so indignant as it
would have been if Alf and ‚ÄôArry had been nearer
than Bayswater. He lifted his hat calmly and said,
‚ÄúGood evening, ma‚Äôam, it‚Äôs a fine evening.‚Äù</p>
<p>Her instinct told her at once that this was not a
gentleman of Mr. Blundon‚Äôs elegance. His clothes
were rich but his manner and spirit were those which
she understood.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen finer,‚Äù she replied with some tartness,
resolved not to give in too easily.</p>
<p>He was really a fine looking old gentLman, about
seventy, she thought, with a fine ruddy face and a
chin beard that was white and cut short and round.
On his black waistcoat glittered a massive gold
watch-chain. He had bland round blue eyes and an
air of good humor. He asked her if she was alone.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNot exactly,‚Äù said Bessie. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm wyting for a
friend.‚Äù</p>
<p>Would she mind if he chatted a bit until her
friend came? No, she said, but she‚Äôd have to stay
there by the fifth light because that was where she
was going to meet her friend.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNice music,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYes, nice music.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve always liked Pomp and Circumstance. It‚Äôs
like the British Empire.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou must be musical,‚Äù she suggested.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI like music.‚Äù</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>195</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm from London,‚Äù she said wistfully. ‚ÄúI came
down here for the air and I ran into my friend.‚Äù</p>
<p>The mention of London appeared to make the old
gentleman a little bolder. ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôd better tell
you my name so you can introduce me when she
comes along.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a he,‚Äù said Bessie, and then noticing the old
gentleman‚Äôs alarm, added, ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs all right. We‚Äôre
only friends.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúOh,‚Äù said her companion. ‚ÄúWell, my name‚Äôs
Winnery ‚Äî Horace J. Winnery.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd mine‚Äôs Cudlip ‚Äî Bessie Cudlip.‚Äù</p>
<p>Horace J. Winnery, she thought, was a beautiful
name like Lionel Blundon, only it didn‚Äôt fill her with
awe. It made her feel quite at home.</p>
<p>The band blared into a potpourri from Faust and
Mr. Blundon came into sight through the crowd.
He was peering to right and to left with his near-
sighted eyes. Bessie, being in a realistic mood,
could not help thinking that her new acquaintance,
even at his age, was more of a man.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs my friend now,‚Äù said Bessie, and Mr.
Winnery with a glance at Mr. Blundon looked re-
lieved of some secret anxiety.</p>
<p>She introduced them and Mr. Winnery was very
cordial, but Mr. Blundon seemed absentminded and
concerned with his own thoughts. But she was
proud of him and hoped that his accent had im-
pressed Mr. Winnery. It would show him what
sort she was.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go and ‚Äôave some ale,‚Äù said old Mr. Win-
nery, so they went and sat in the pavilion and drank
together. It seemed to cheer Mr. Blundon. It</p>

<p>196 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>was the first time he had had a drop since Christmas
Eve.</p>
<p>Mr. Winnery, who wanted clearly to be friendly,
relaxed a great deal more and began telling them
the story of his life in a voice loud enough to com-
pete with the Soldiers‚Äô Chorus. He was in Brigh-
ton, he said, for a spell and he didn‚Äôt think much of
Brighton. Frankly, it was getting on his nerves.
In his opinion it was a poor place. London for him
every time. He was lonely. It was funny but he‚Äôd
been hoping he‚Äôd run into some young people. He
was a bit of a gay dog himself and didn‚Äôt feel a day
over thirty. He‚Äôd lost his wife some months ago.
That was why he was wearing black clothes. He
didn‚Äôt like black clothes but you had to wear them.
Not that she wasn‚Äôt a good sort. He‚Äôd been mar-
ried to her for forty years and when you‚Äôd had some-
body about for forty years you missed them when
they were gone. Would they have another drink?
Yes. It was a hot night. He was always thirsty
on hot nights. He was a ship‚Äôs chandler, and a good
business it was, too. He‚Äôd made a lot of money at
it. And now he was trying to enjoy himself, but he
couldn‚Äôt do it alone, not alone. You had to have
somebody to enjoy things with you.</p>
<p>(At this point the band swept gayly into a pot-
pourri from Cavalleria Rusticana and Mr. Blundon
dropped into a quiet slumber.) ‚ÄúLike most
drunks,‚Äù thought Bessie, ‚Äú ‚Äôe‚Äôs got a weak head. It
ain‚Äôt that he drinks so much.‚Äù She considered his
behavior a proper breach of manners but she hadn‚Äôt
the courage to disturb him.</p>
<p>Mr. Winnery was still shouting above Mascagni‚Äôs</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>197</p>
<p>best effort. Maybe if they weren‚Äôt too busy they‚Äôd
spend a little time with him. It would be his treat.</p>
<p>He had plenty of money.</p>
<p>Bessie said Mr. Blundon was working in the day-
time, but that she had nothing to do. He was writ-
ing a book, she explained impressively.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAh,‚Äù breathed Mr. Winnery, impressed. ‚ÄúA
book. What kind of a book?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù said Bessie. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a book.‚Äù</p>
<p>The band stopped playing and began putting its
brass instruments to bed in green baize. Bessie
thought it was time for them all to go home and
awakened Mr. Blundon. Together the three of
them walked to the end of the pier. She noticed that
Mr. Blundon was a little unsteady. On the prom-
enade Mr. Winnery bade them a polite good-night.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPerhaps,‚Äù he suggested, ‚Äúwe might meet in the
morning. Say ten o‚Äôclock.‚Äù</p>
<p>Mr. Blundon offered no objections. He did not
even seem to hear. ‚ñ†</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù said Bessie. ‚ñ†</p>
<p>T</p>
<p>VII I</p>
<p>Bessie liked the old gentleman. He was, she told I</p>
<p>herself, one of her sort, out for a good time. All I</p>
<p>the black clothes and Homburg hats and black um-
brellas in the world could not dampen the twinkle in
his blue eyes or the healthy pink in his cheeks.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen he was young,‚Äù she speculated, ‚Äúhe must
have been a wild ‚Äôun.‚Äù She was growing a little
bored with Mr. Blundon‚Äôs quiet way of living. Bes-
sie w‚Äôas one who could not do without her fun.</p>
<p>198 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>She met old Mr. Winnery the following day.
She even arrived at the rendezvous a little before
the hour agreed upon. It was the wedding of twin
spirits. They walked the promenade together
and rode in donkey carts and went to the cinema and
drank ale in large quantities. (Both, unlike Mr.
Blundon, were blessed with hard heads.) They
had lunch in the showiest hotels and restaurants,
such places as Bessie had never before dreamed of
entering. Indeed, Bessie began to think that she
was cut out for a grand life. Mr. Winnery was
never awkward in such places ; he had an assurance
beside which the elegant Mr. Blundon seemed a
cringing creature. Mr. Winnery could buy anything
he wanted and going about with such a gentleman
was a new experience for Bessie. He bought her
trinkets ‚Äî a barette set with brilliants for her taSy-
colored hair, a spotted veil which she admired and
which gave her a fast look. She kept thinking, ‚ÄúI
wish that Teena Bitts could see me now.&rdquo; She
squealed with delight in shooting galleries and places
where she garnered gaudy vases and trinkets by
throwing hoops over them. She and Mr. Winnery
came to think Brighton the gayest place in the world.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Mr. Blundon worked uninterrupted
in the daytime and accompanied them at night to the
band concerts. Sometimes he drank a little too
much and Bessie was forced to steer him home. It
was all very gay and everyone was very happy until
one day Bessie, who seldom thought of such things,
looked in the old stocking where she kept her money
and found that there remained only three pounds
and ten shillings. The Paradise of Brighton was at</p>
<p>an end unless she found an Alf or a ‚ÄôArry, and that,
she told herself, was difficult with Mr. Blundon on
one side and Mr. Winnery on the other taking up all
her time. Mr. Winnery might have been an aid
but he, like Mr. Blundon, showed no interest in love-
making, that is, if you discounted an occasional
furtive pinch or shady joke. There seemed to be no
way out but to bid old Mr. Winnery a sorrowful
farewell and conduct Mr. Blundon, whose health
seemed much improved, back to Bayswater where
she knew her ground.</p>
<p>The next morning while she and Mr. Winnery
were drinking together she told him that her visit
w&rsquo;as at an end, and old Mr. Winnery very nearly
caused her to faint by asking her to marry him. She
did not accept at once for she had, of course, to con-
sider Mr. Blundon. She could not turn him out
abruptly into the world to fall back into poverty and
drankenness. Besides, she would miss him. He
would leave a hole in her life. So she told Mr.
Winnery the whole story, out and out, even to the
fact that although they had long shared a room
there was nothing between them. She gave it as
her opinion that Mr. Blundon was too sickly to be
interested in such things. She told the story re-
gretfully, feeling that she was driving the last nail
into the coffin of her adventure with Mr. Winnery.</p>
<p>But Mr. Winnery proved himself a gentleman in
every sense of the word. He believed the story, he
told her, moved perhaps by the certainty that Bessie
was too guileless to have invented such a tale. Her
generosity, he said, made him care for her all the
more deeply. As to Mr. Blundon, he could go on in</p>
<p>200</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>his present state until he was well enough to fight his
own battles in the world. Mr. Winnery would pay
the expenses. Oh, yes, it would be a pleasure. He
had plenty of money. And in that way they could
be married at once. He implied a little sadly that
he probably hadn^t long to live and now that he‚Äôd
found a companion that enjoyed life the way he did,
he didn‚Äôt want to waste any time. He told her
about his house In Bloomsbury, his victoria and his
brougham and his horses and his business. They
would travel, he said. He‚Äôd always wanted to
travel and find out about the world but he never had
been able to get away from the docks, and Amanda
‚Äî that was his late wife ‚Äî had always made such a
fuss when traveling.</p>
<p>She said she would speak to Mr. Blundon. She
couldn‚Äôt say yes or no until she found out how he
took It.</p>
<p>VlII</p>
<p>When she regained the lodging house she found
the room in disorder. The books were mostly lying
on the floor and Mr. Blundon‚Äôs precious manuscript
was scattered from one end of the room to the other.
There was an ominous scent of brandy in the air. At
first she did not see Mr. Blundon. It was only after
she had set about putting the room in order that she
discovered him. He was lying half in, half out of
the closet, entirely hidden by the open door. Only
his feet were in view. And he was dead to the
world.</p>
<p>&lsquo;\3he thought, ‚ÄúIt was that first drink at the
pavilion. It got ‚Äôim started again,‚Äù</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>201</p>
<p>After she had lifted him into the bed, she picked
up the books. No, she could not marry Mr. Win-
nery and desert poor Mr. Blundon to drink himself
to death. It was like turning a puppy out into the
cold. Still maybe she owed it to herself to be hard-
hearted and forget him. She couldn‚Äôt go on
forever. &hellip;</p>
<p>Then as she was sorting the numbered sheets of
illegible manuscript, she found among them a bit of
paper that did not belong there. It was a sheet of
mauve paper and there was a purple coronet in the
corner and under it was printed Narkworth Abbey,
Middlebox, Surrey. The letter began, ‚ÄúMy dear
Cousin Lionel‚Äù and was written in the crabbed and
trembling hand of an aged person.</p>
<p>Bessie began to feel a little sick but curiosity
pressed her and she read on. . ‚ÄúI have taken up your
case with your cousin, the Duke, but he is unwilling
to do anything. He remains firm in his belief that
you have disgraced the family and the name of
Blundon not once but many times and that you have
been at all times stubborn and unregenerate. I be-
lieve I am quoting his own words correctly. I have
done my best to soften him, but as you know, he is
a hard man. The Blundons are always hard.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI have disobeyed him in writing you. He for-
bade any communication whatever unless, of course,
you are willing to go to Africa or Australia. You
know he is extremely close and allows me barely
enough money to run the two houses, the one here
and the one at Prince‚Äôs Gate. Therefore I am able
to spare you only the small amount enclosed.‚Äù</p>
<p>202</p>
<p>THE STRANGE C4.SE OF</p>
<p>(The cheque, thought Bessie, which he had spent
in getting drunk.)</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am glad to hear that your health is better and
that you are working. I hope you will continue in
the same condition, living quietly and respectably
and that your health will not again be affected. I
have never been to Brighton but hear that the air
is good except for those who have livers.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am, with best wishes, your aunt</p>
<p>‚ÄúLetitia,</p>
<p>‚ÄúDuchess of N arkworth.‚Äù</p>
<p>For the only time in her life, Bessie felt faint.
She sat down and read the letter through a second
time. So the lie she told Teena Bitts had turned
out to be true. Mr. Blundon was the cousin of a
duke. She felt suddenly dizzy and to steady her-
self took a drink of what remained in Mr. Blundon‚Äôs
bottle. Then she stared for a time at the frail small
figure sleeping on the bed with its mouth open. She
thought of Mr. Winnery asking her to marry him.
‚ÄúIt ain‚Äôt true,‚Äù she told herself. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like any
blooming nightmare.‚Äù It was like something she
had made up. It was like a cinema. That little
thing on the bed was the cousin of a duke.</p>
<p>Overcome with emotion she began to blubber.
No, she couldn‚Äôt turn Mr. Blundon out into the
cold ‚Äî ^not ‚Äôim, the cousin of a duke. He wasn‚Äôt
made to get on in the world. Somebody would
have to look after him. Well, she‚Äôd explain to Mr.
Winnery how she couldn‚Äôt desert Mr. Blundon.</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>203</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>i! But when Mr. Winnery set his mind on a thing he</p>
<p>got it, so the unfortunate collapse of Mr, Blundon
made no difference. When Mr. Blundon had re-
1 covered a little, the three of them went back to Lon-</p>
<dl>
<dt>don, only not to Bayswater this time, but to Blooms-</dt>
<dt>bury, where Mr. Blundon was put in lodgings near</dt>
<dd>enough at hand so that Bessie might keep an eye on</dd>
</dl>
<p>him. Bessie herself, with the new-found airs ac-
quired from Mr. Winnery at Brighton, went to a
i temperance hotel. She objected to this and it was</p>
<p>f only later that she understood the subtlety of this</p>
<p>; move of Mr. Winneiy.</p>
<p>I It had never occurred to her that Mr. Winnery</p>
<p>f had any relatives. He had always seemed to her</p>
<p>a gift from God sent to destroy the fit of misery
which had seized her that night by the fifth light on
the Brighton pier. It was only when Mr. Winnery
j announced the banns that the relatives came sud-</p>
<p>denly to light, filled with fury and indignation.
There appeared two pious and rather dreary maiden
sisters older than Mr. Winnery who lived at Scar-
borough on his largesse, and an orphan nephew who
lived in Italy. The two sisters made the first move
[&rsquo; by telegraphing in distress to the nephew, who came</p>
<p>ail the way from Italy to London.</p>
<p>The interview took place in the common sitting
room of the temperance hotel and Bessie acquitted
I herself with dignity. The nephew, Mr. Winnery of</p>
<p>Brinoe, was smallish, about forty, with a bald spot
I and an air of condescension toward his uncle. It</p>
<p>I appeared from his insinuations that he was a su-</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>K</p>
<p>204</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>perlor, cultivated and literary figure. Bessie, who
had only one standard in judging gentlemen, thought
him rather a poor thing. He had been educated at
Oxford by old Mr. Winnery and had an accent a
little like Mr. Blundon, a fact that helped to put
Bessie at her ease, since instead of awing her it now
seemed quite familiar.</p>
<p>She put on an air of style, taking care to point out
that it was old Mr. Winnery who wanted the mar-
riage and not herself. In fact he had insisted upon
marrying her despite the fact that she herself had
raised many objections. She knew, she said, that
she could make him happy in his declining years.
They had already discovered that.</p>
<p>Although she had developed a great deal of
‚Äúcharacter‚Äù since she left the Pot and Pie, she was
not to be tempted by promises of money to be paid
after the two sisters and Mr. Winnery of Brinoe had
come into the old gentleman‚Äôs estate. The idea in-
deed made her indignant. She pointed out that she
was a friend of Mr. Winnery and not of his money
and that she would have married him just the same
if he hadn‚Äôt had a penny, which was quite true. She
felt in his debt for the good time at Brighton and
she was one of the few whose happiness is scarcely
affected by money.</p>
<p>There was nothing to be done and in the end the
Italian Mr. Winnery went back gloomily to Italy
and the spinster sisters returned to Scarborough to
tell day after day the story of how their respectable
brother had been kidnapped by a cheap woman
young enough to be his granddaughter.</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>203</p>
<p>X</p>
<p>Bessie was married to Mr. Winnery at the regis-
try office in the presence of three employees of the
ship chandler‚Äôs firm of Winnery and Company.
Mr. Blundon managed to leave his book long
enough to be present. He looked very nice in the
new clothes Bessie and Mr. Winnery bought him
for the occasion.</p>
<p>And Bessie, dressed in the finery lavished upon
her by an adoring bridegroom, went on her bridal
tour to Paris. They stayed at the Grand Hotel,
where Bessie had but to open her window at any
hour of the day or night to look out upon the crowds
and gayety of the boulevards. They went to music
halls and dined each night in a different restaurant
and climbed the Eiffel Tower and visited the races
and were astonished by the chocolate splendor of the
opera. Mr. Winnery was happy as a boy and Paris
became for them only a glorified Brighton.</p>
<p>It was only when Bessie went back to the house
in Bloomsbury that she became aware for the first
time in her life of that mental state known as temp-
tation. The house bore the imprint of the late
Amanda Winnery, a religious woman and a stout
believer until her death in the professions of the
Plymouth Brethern. The furniture was mostly of
black teakwood and red plush embellished by a large
amount of inlaid funereal marble. In each room
framed legends set forth such thoughts as Repent
Lest Ye Fall Into the Hands of the Devil, and
He That Looiceth Upon the Wine When It Is
Red Is in Danger of Hell Fire. These had been</p>
<p>2o6 the strange case of</p>
<p>embroidered in appropriately sombre colors by
Amanda Winnery and long ago had turned faded
and dusty. Bessie found them depressing. During
the first few weeks, especially at those moments
when the cheerful Mr. Winnery was not in the
house, she was filled with a terrible desire to make a
visit to the Pot and Pie. Alone in the depths of that
mausoleum, her soul cried out for the companion-
ship of Teena Bitts, Alf and ‚ÄôArry and old Mrs.
Grumyss.</p>
<p>Then slowly, bit by bit, the presence of Amanda
Winnery‚Äôs virtuous ghost began to give way to the
presence of the very living Bessie. The framed
legends slowly disappeared, whither no one knew,
and In their place appeared bright chromos pur-
chased in Mile End Road and a great deal of brass
work, for which Bessie developed a great taste.
And last of all, a gramophone, a parrot, two
canaries and a pair of white poodles made their ap-
pearance. She loved food and drink with a passion
equalled only by that of Mr. Winnery and so they
gave themselves over to a perpetual orgy of eating
and drinking. She gracefully allowed her natural
indolence to take possession of her, sometimes not
troubling to dress until the evening, and each day
she grew plumper and plumper and, to the taste of
the old-fashioned Mr. Winnery, more desirable.
Mr. Winnery beamed with happiness and for the
first time in all his seventy years, life seemed to be
what he had always believed that it should be. In
his lodgings Mr. Blundon seemed to be content.
She visited him three or four times weekly and his
spells of drunkenness grew fewer and fewer. He</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>207</p>
<p>lived quite comfortably on the money allowed him
by Bessie, and Mr. Winnery grew to have quite an
affection for him, and to share the pride which
Bessie found in supporting the cousin of a duke.</p>
<p>It might have gone on forever thus but that Mr.
Winnery was, when all was said and done, an old
man, and drinking and eating was certain to take its
toll. One night while Bessie sat in her wrapper
reading John Bull on the opposite side of the fire
from Mr. Winnery she noticed that the newspaper
with which he covered his face when he slept was
very still and that his hands hung down in a queer
fashion. She went over to him and lifted the news-
paper. He was quite dead. He had simply gone
to sleep in the midst of his happiness, warm and con-
tent after a good dinner, with his Bessie sitting
opposite him.</p>
<p>XI</p>
<p>What might have been called the Last Phase of
Bessie began on the day after the funeral when the
will was read. Save for the money to continue the
income of the maiden sisters living in Scarborough,
the income of the entire fortune was left to Bessie
Cudlip Winnery. There was no provision made
for the nephew who lived in Brinoe, save the ironical
one that on the death of Bessie Cudlip Winnery, the
entire fortune was to go to him. And Bessie was
more than ten years younger than her nephew and
in the most robust of health and spirits. But she
was of a forgiving nature, and understanding per-
haps the nephew‚Äôs agitation at the time of her
marriage to Mr. Winnery, she arranged that</p>
<p>2o8 the. strange CASE &rsquo; of '</p>
<p>the usual income was to be sent to Brinoe out of her
own money. So now, with Mr. Blundon, she sup-
ported two gentlemen instead of one.</p>
<p>She dressed herself in the thickest and blackest
crepe and then discovered something which she had
not noticed before ‚Äî ^that for nearly four years old
Mr. Winnery had been her entire life and that with-
out him she was lost. He had taken the place of
Bayswater and the Pot and Pie and of Alf and
‚ÄôArry and Teena Bitts and Mrs. Crumyss and now
she had neither the one nor the other. As she had
grown immensely fat and very indolent, she did
nothing about it for a long time. Even the tempta-
tion to return to the Pot and Pie seemed to have
weakened, or at least taken another form. She
wanted to return now on a single visit only to show
Teena Bitts and Winterbottom how well she had
done.</p>
<p>Her only diversion was an occasional visit to the
lodgings of Mr. Biundon. Sometimes he was in and
sometimes not and when she did find him there he
received her with the same dignity and detachment
that had marked their long friendship. But, as
Bessie said, he was never much of a one for small
talk and their conversation lagged. The dialogue
consisted usually of inquiries about the book, the
character of which remained a perpetual mystery
to Bessie, and remarks about the weather. The
regeneration of Mr. Biundon seemed well on the
way to become an accomplished fact. He no longer
got drunk, and in decent clothes appeared the gen-
tleman he was by birth. He was fond of Bessie,
but cold, and her own attitude toward him was a</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 209</p>
<p>Httle that of a ^ hen that had mothered a ducklinff.
Jnly once had he ever lost his temper and that was
on the occasion when she suggested that the book
must be nearly finished and that surely it would be
m many volumes. At which Mr. Blundon told her
that It was a monumental and erudite work and that
she wouldn‚Äôt understand it even when it was finished.
Bessie wept a little, not because her feelings were
hurt (she knew he was quite right about her under-
standing any book) but because the book had not
been finished before the death of Mr. Winnery He
jould have understood it, she said. He was a won-
aertul man and understood everything. She was
very lonely without him. Life wasn‚Äôt the same.
Perhaps, she suggested tearfully, Mr. Blundon
would like sometime to drive out in the victoria with
ncr and the poodles.</p>
<p>_ But Mr. Blundon told her that he detested ridins&rsquo;
m victorias and that the motion made him seasick</p>
<p>at&rsquo;thrbnf?^ ^ disappointment because</p>
<p>i f ^ f T proposal lay a crafty plan. She</p>
<p>ad hoped that one afternoon they would make an
early start and that suddenly they would find them-</p>
<p>and Pi? &lsquo;she Bayswater before the Pot</p>
<p>and Fie. She had pictured to herself the triumnh</p>

<p>210</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>rectlon In search of human companionship. She
simply wanted people to be friendly. She wanted
small talk, of this and that, spiced perhaps by sallies
like those of old Mrs. Crumyss. So she turned to
her own servants, the cook and two housemaids, but
the results were disastrous. After two weeks of
dreadful uneasiness, all three gave notice and sought
mistresses who would not seek to be intimate with
them.</p>
<p>In despair Bessie told herself that as the widow
of Horace J. Winnery she could not frequent public
houses. In any case she could not go comfortably
on foot and ladies who frequented pubs did not
drive up to the door in a victoria with a coachman.
It wasn‚Äôt that she wanted to drink. She could do
that at home. She wanted simply an excuse for a
talk.</p>
<p>At last she hit upon the idea of going to Brighton
in the hope that if she did not find it gay she might
at least recapture memories of that lovely visit with
Mr. Blundon and Mr. Winnery. So with a great
effort she got off at last and at Brighton took a
gilded sitting room and bedroom in the showiest ho-
tel in the place. She hired a victoria and went driv-
ing with the poodles. She sometimes went down to
the beach and sat under a black umbrella while they
yapped and barked for stones thrown them by the
children. She sat gloomily listening to Pomp and
Circumstance and potpourris from Faust, Carmen
and Cavalleria Rusticana. She sat drearily in dark
cinemas. She could not frequent places where you
could shoot at ducks and giraffes made of painted
tin nor toss hoops over Japanese vases. She found</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 211</p>
<p>that hers was a nature that could not live upon
memories. She was trying to enjoy herself but she
couldn‚Äôt do it, not alone. You had to have some-
body to enjoy things with you.</p>
<p>In the end she began again to hate Brighton as
she had hated it the first time she saw it. Only this
time it was worse because she didn‚Äôt even have the
gloomy Mr. Blundon to sit with her in the evenings.</p>
<p>But Brighton appeared to occupy a prominent
place in the horoscope of Bessie, and two days be-
fore she planned to end her visit as a failure she
made by accident the acquaintance of a lady and
gentleman sitting at the next table to her in the
pavilion.</p>
<p>Bessie wouldn‚Äôt have noticed them, for they were
quiet and drab and she had no taste for drab people,
but the lady took a fancy to Esther, the poodle
which she had In her lap. The lady asked Esther‚Äôs
name and so opened the conversation. One thing
led to another. The lady and gentleman were Mr.
and Mrs. John Willis and their speech had that
faint cockney echo which always warmed Bessie‚Äôs
heart. They were from London, they said, and
didn t care much for Brighton. It seemed a poor
place and much overrated. Bessie said she thouglit
so too. She was from London. Yes, she lived in
Bloomsbury.</p>
<p>Mrs. Willis, who was a dark, nervous little
woman of middle age, said, ‚ÄúBloomsbury‚Äî well, I
never. That‚Äôs where Mr. Willis and I live.‚Äù</p>
<p>212</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>A glow emanated from Bessie‚Äôs heart and took
possession of her whole body. Bloomsbury, well, I
never. Queer, and they lived quite near each other
and never knew it. Funny how you could live in
Bloomsbury for years and never know your nearest
neighbor. It was an exclusive community. Mr. Wil-
lis, a little blond man with spectacles and a walrus
moustache said that was the way life was, he‚Äôd
found, and wasn‚Äôt the music nice. That was the
only thing they liked about Brighton ‚Äî the band
concerts. Indeed, they were about to cut short their
visit and go back to London, where they felt more
at home. They were going to stay Uivo more days
just to give the place a fair trial. It w&rsquo;as Mr. ‚ÄôWillis‚Äôs
first real holiday in fifteen years. Yes, he was a
busy man. He had a linen shop and you could never
trust people who worked for you.</p>
<p>Queer, said Bessie, she felt the same way about
Brighton. She was going the day after tomorrow.
Maybe they could go up together. How was she
traveling? On the express, first class.</p>
<p>Mrs. Willis was afraid they couldn‚Äôt travel like
that. They weren‚Äôt rich enough. When you‚Äôve a
shop you have to mind how you spend your money.</p>
<p>Perhaps then, suggested Bessie, they would travel
with her, as her guests. She‚Äôd like it. She had
plenty of money and she‚Äôd been hoping she‚Äôd meet
someone to enjoy things with her. It wasn‚Äôt any
good trying to enjoy things alone. It would be a
pleasure.</p>
<p>But Mr. Willis, who appeared to be cautious,
said he‚Äôd have to think it over.</p>
<p>The band finished playing a potpourri from Ca-</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>213</p>
<p>valleria Rusticana and began putting away its instru-
ments in receptacles of green baize. Mrs. Willis
thought perhaps they‚Äôd all better be going to bed,
so Bessie paid the bill for everything and they set
out slowly, for Bessie found It difficult to move very
fast. As they walked she said she had no children
(which was quite true) and so was very fond of
dogs. The Willises must see her other poodle,
Minnie. Minnie was at home because her chest was
weak and Bessie didn‚Äôt think the night air at the
seaside was good for her.</p>
<p>Queer, said Mrs. Willis, they hadn‚Äôt any children
either, although they‚Äôd prayed for them. But she
managed to fill in her time in church work. That
helped a great deal and it was sociable. Did Mrs.
Winnery go to any particular church ?</p>
<p>Bessie said no, that she wasn‚Äôt much of a one for
church. (Indeed, she had never seen the inside of
a church.) She‚Äôd come to Bloomsbury a stranger
and she‚Äôd never yet found her way about.</p>
<p>Mrs. Willis said she must come to their chapel.
She was sure that she‚Äôd feel at home there, and
Bessie said they must both come and have Sunday
dinner with her. At the end of the pier Bessie‚Äôs
hired victoria was waiting and she drove them home
to their shabby lodgings. They parted the best of
friends.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe might meet tomorrow,‚Äù suggested Bessie.
‚ÄúThat would be fine,‚Äù said Mrs. Willis.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAbout ten-thirty at the end of the pier,‚Äù said
Bessie. She waved back to them gaily as she drove
off to the splendor of her own suite at thejgeorge
and Crown.</p>
<p>214 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>The next day proved a great success, so great a
success that they all decided to stay five days longer.
Bessie it was who paid the expenses. It gave her
pleasure, she said, and she had plenty of money.
And in the end they all went back to London on the
express, first class, with a compartment to them-
selves because Bessie felt uneasy when anyone like
Mr. Blundon was put in the same compartment with</p>
<p>Jji Bloomsbury Bessie went to the cnapel and IVIi.
and Mrs. Willis came home in the victoria to Sun-
day dinner. She did not care especially for the ser-
mon nor for the boredom of sitting an hour uud
a half in a hard pew, but she had found human com-
panionship and she told herself that she couldn‚Äôt
have everything. Mrs. Willis admired the brass
collection and the chromos and Bessie sent her as
a gift a female white poodle. It was the beginning
of a great friendship. From then on Bessie at-
tended the chapel regularly save on those Sundays
when she found the effort to dress quite beyond her
power of will.</p>
<p>She got used to the services and came to endure
them but she found her real pleasure in the meetings
of the ladies and all the auxiliary activities of the
chapel. She could sit and drink her fill of amiable
talk. And for the chapel she proved a godsend.
In a congregation of small linen drapers, green-
grocers and clerks, she appeared to be a female
Midas. And because she wanted everybody to be
happy she bought a grand new organ for the chapel
and had new windows put in and presented it with
a baptismal font. Out of gratitude the members</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>215</p>
<p>of the congregation had carved upon it, ‚ÄúPresented
to St. John‚Äôs Chapel by Bessie Cudlip Winnery.‚Äù
As for Bessie, she was happy. She had only one
desire ‚Äî that Teena BItts might walk in some Sun-
day and read that inscription on the baptismal font.</p>
<p>It was Bessie, too, who established the famous
August Bank Holiday Excursion and Annual Pic-
nic. Oddly enough it was Mr.-Blundon who sug-
gested to her the idea. He thought it would be
splendid if the children of the congregation could
get into the countiy more often, so Bessie made It
an annual affair. On the August Bank Holiday she
hired char-a-bancs and, packing into them all the
Sunday School children and as many of the parents
as were free, set off Into the country for the day.
She herself occupied a seat in the back of the first
char-a-banc, leading the way and filled with happi-
ness. After the second year the excursions became
so celebrated that people joined the chapel and sent
. their children to Sunday School for the sake of the</p>
<p>single uproarious outing.</p>
<p>In the fourth year after Bessie met Mr. and Mrs.
Willis, two momentous things happened. One was
the death of the poodles. Esther died of old age
and Minnie of the lung complaint which had
troubled her for so long. Bessie bought two new
poodles but they were never the same, she told Mr.
Willis, because she had had Esther and Minnie
while Mr. Winnery was still alive and their deaths
i were like the breaking of a chain that bound her to</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>In the midst of her grief she was sitting one
I afternoon in the window of the drawing room</p>
<p>216</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>(happily dressed) and listening to the gramophone
when an antiquated and high-pitched Rolls Royce
drove up and stopped before the door. At sight of
it Bessie withdrew quickly behind the curtains but
not so quickly that she wasn‚Äôt able to see that it had
on the door a coronet exactly like the one she had
seen on the letter found in Mr. Blundon‚Äôs room so
many years before. A footman rang the bell and
in a moment Briggs came in trembling, pale and
shaken, to ask if Mrs. Winnery could receive ‚Äú ‚Äôer
Gryce, the Duchess of Narkworth.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúNow,‚Äù thought Bessie, ‚Äú ‚Äôes‚Äôs done it. E‚Äôs gone
and told ‚Äôer the whole thing.‚Äù</p>
<p>Peering from behind the curtain she saw a little
old woman dressed very queerly in black with a
black bonnet and parasol get down from the Rolls
Royce and come up the steps.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe ain‚Äôt so awesome,‚Äù thought Bessie with re-
lief. ‚ÄúShe looks just like old Mrs. Grubb that sits
in the third pew at chapel.‚Äù</p>
<p>The little old lady came in and Bessie received
her with all the grace of manner Mr. Winnery had
taught her. Would ‚Äôer Gryce sit down? And did
she mind the poodle puppies? No, it appeared, ‚Äôer
Gryce didn‚Äôt mind, she kept spaniels herself ‚Äî
cockers ‚Äî and she was very attached to them.
Bessie told her about the death of Esther and Min-
nie, not without shedding a tear and explaining their
relation to the late Mr. Winnery.</p>
<p>And then ‚Äôer Gryce came to the point. She too
had just lost her husband a little while before and
since he was dead there had been a reconciliation
between her and Mr. Blundon, the cousin of the</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 217</p>
<p>late Duke. Indeed Mr. Blundon had gone to the
funeral and then came to Narkworth House for
lunch. And a very changed Mr. Blundon he was
from the last time she had seen him. He was even
cheerful and happy. And after lunch he had taken
‚Äôer Gryce aside and told her what had happened to
him and how it was a Mr. and Mrs. Winnery who
had taken an interest in him and helped him when
his own family had cast him out. (Not that Mrs.
Winnery must think the worse of the dear Duke.
He was a good man but hard. The Blundons were
all hard. And Mr. Blundon had given him, as the
head of the family, a great deal of trouble.) So
she had come to thank Mrs. Winnery for what she
had been doing ail these years. If the dear Duke
hadn‚Äôt been In his grave he would have come too,
out of thankfulness for seeing Mr. Blundon such a
changed creature.</p>
<p>Bessie said that what she‚Äôd done was nothing and
that it had given her and Mr. Winnery great pleas-
ure and that they were very fond of Mr. Blundon
and couldn‚Äôt have got on without him.</p>
<p>‚ÄôEr Gryce said that now it was arranged for Mr.
Blundon to live in the dower house at Narkworth
and go on with his writing. He had told her that
he was at work on a book which he would have fin-
ished shortly and would publish. He had been reti-
cent about it. Did Mrs. Winnery know what it was
about ?</p>
<p>No, Bessie said, it was, she supposed, just a book.
But it was really too bad about Mr. Blundon going
to live at Narkworth. She‚Äôd miss having him there
in Bloomsbury. It would he a hole in her life.</p>
<p>2I8</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>But ‚Äôer Gryce said Mr. Blundon was going to
keep the lodging in Bloomsbury to stop in when he
came to town. He had grown fond of the place.
She didn‚Äôt suppose there was anything she could do
for Bessie, but she wanted her to know how grateful
the family had been for what she had done.</p>
<p>Then Bessie suggested that ‚Äôer Giyce have a drop
of tea and the old lady lifted her veil and said she
would be delighted to have some and, after the
trembling Briggs had been sent to fetch it, they fell
to discussing this and that and Bessie told her about
the chapel and the August Bank Holiday Excursion
and Annual Picnic. ‚ÄôEr Gryce said she was inter-
ested in such ideas. She proved to be a very pious
old lady and much interested in work among the
poor. She would send Mrs. Winnery a cheque to
help along her good work, which seemed to be grow-
ing at such a pace that Mrs. Winnery would soon
find it beyond her means.</p>
<p>They drank tea together and became verj^ friendly
and ‚Äôer Gryce suggested that they might meet again
and plan a place at Narkworth where tired girls
could be sent for a rest. Mrs. Winnery might help
her with the London end of it. Her daughter-in-
law, the present Duchess, who was Miss Mazie
Ffolliott of the Gaiety, had already been a great
help in recruiting tired girls from the music halls. It
was a plan she had had in mind for a long time. She
could, she thought, house as many as twelve girls at
a time in the old Abbey at Narkworth. She was hav-
ing plumbing laid down. She had begun the day
after the dear Duke‚Äôs funeral. Perhaps Mrs. Win-
nery would come and have lunch with her one day</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>219</p>
<p>at Narkworth House and they would talk it over.
But Bessie said she didn‚Äôt go out much and maybe
‚Äôer Gryce would come instead to Bloomsbury.</p>
<p>Bessie went with her to the door and was standing
there when ‚Äôer Gryce drove off bowing and waving
pretty as anything from the window of the antique
Rolls. She was very nice, thought Bessie, and not a
bit like a Duchess. She reminded her in a way of
old Mrs. Crumyss if you forgot the way Mrs.
Crumyss talked and drank.</p>
<p>That evening Bessie dropped in to see Mrs.
Willis and gave her a finely detailed account of ‚Äôer
Gryce‚Äôs call.</p>
<p>The visit roused again the old temptation to re-
turn to the Pot and Pie. She was tormented by the
desire to just drop in in passing to tell Teena Bitts
about ‚Äôer Gryce. But she could not go until after
the August Bank Holiday, which was only six days
off. There was too much to be done in preparation
for the Excursion and Annual Picnic. This year
the crowd would need fourteen char-a-bancs. When
that was over she would drive back to Bays-water in
splendor just for one afternoon to show Teena and
Winterbottom and Mrs. Crumyss.</p>
<p>XIII</p>
<p>The great day came and Bessie, sitting high in
the back of the first char-a-banc, watched Mr. Willis
twirling his walrus moustache and getting the crowd
organized. At last they were off in an uproar of
motors and a cloud of fluttering flags representing
about equally the British Empire and St. John‚Äôs</p>
<p>220</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>Chapel. She wished again that Teena Bitts and old
Mrs. Crumyss could see her.</p>
<p>They went to Nottingham Forest and there under
the trees with the efficient direction of Mr. Willis
they spread out the food from great hampers.
There were all kinds of sandwiches, roast Beef and
mutton, sausages, tarts and fruit, and quantities of
ice-cold beer, a real feast such as appealed to the
Gargantuan imagination of Bessie. Then Mr. Wil-
lis organized a gymkhana in wdiich all the children
and some of the grown-ups took part, and all this
led up in the end to the peak of interest ‚Äî a race be-
tween the fat men of the congregation and the fat
ladies of the congregation. There were twenty-
three entries in this event but when the lineup came,
Bessie was not among them. At her absence a cry
went up from all present. She, the fattest woman in
the congregation, was entered ! She, Mrs. Winner}‚Äô‚Äô,
who was responsible for all the fun 1 It v,?ouldn‚Äôt be
any i*ace at all if she didn‚Äôt take part in it. (Among
the fat ones it was already decided to fix the race
and allow her to win.) The children gathered
around her crying, ‚ÄúGo along, Mrs. Winnery,‚Äù and
Bessie protested and laughed, laughed until she be-
came hysterical, but in the end she yielded and, re-
moving her hat and jacket, took her place with the
others.</p>
<p>The race was to be run from the green char-a-banc
to the foot of the great oak that stood on the edge
of the road. The whole congregation lined the edge
of the course. Among the slim gentlemen bets were
placed as to the winner. Shrieks of merriment
shattered the forest stillness. And at last Mr.</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>221</p>
<p>Willis dropped the napkin that was the starting sig-
nal and they were off. Bessie got off in the midst
and was making remarkable speed for so large a
woman. Cries of encouragement went up from all
sides, for Bessie was the favorite, such a favorite as
there had never been in any race. There was not
one who did not want her to win. And Bessie was
doing her best, although very nearly helpless with
lau^ter. Slowly she forged ahead into the lead.
Fifteen more yards and the victory would be hers.</p>
<p>But suddenly something happened. It seemed
that she tripped over something, perhaps a root, and
fell to the ground. A cry went up and fifty people
ran to help her. But when they got to her side, she
seemed unable to rise. She lay there quite still,
breathing with difficulty. Six men carried her into
the shade of the great oak. They brought water
and fanned her and from somewhere in the congre-
gation there appeared an unsuspected bottle of
brandy. They poured part of this between her
lips. But there was nothing to be done. Her
breathing stopped presently. She had died of apo-
plexy in the midst of merriment.</p>

<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>end he said, rather sentimentally, ‚ÄúFor one reason,
if not for countless others, she will always be re-
membered among us. It can be said of her that she
shared all she had and that her only desire was that
others should be happy like herself.‚Äù</p>
<p>It was Mr. Blundon himself who, as her oldest
friend, consulted with Mr. and Mrs. Willis about
the tombstone. They decided upon it at last ‚Äî a
simple stone with the inscription:</p>
<p>HERE LIES</p>
<p>Bessie Cudlip Winnery</p>
<p>WIDOW</p>
<p>OF</p>
<p>Horace J. Winnery
Died August ‚Äî ^ at the age of forty-six years

Picnic of St. John‚Äôs Chapel</p>

ALL THINGS BOTH GREAT AND S.MALL

<p>The two poodles went to join the poodle Bessie
had given Mrs. Willis and the house was closed and
sold, and the following w&rsquo;eek Mr. Blundon‚Äôs book
was published. It was in two large volumes and
was named A History of Prostitution, Reli-
gious AND Secular. It was an excellent and eru-
dite book and received scholarly notices. On the
flyleaf appeared the dedication, ‚ÄúTo Mr. and Mrs.
Horace J. Winnery, whose Friendship and Aid
Made the Writing of This Book Possible.‚Äù</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>223</p>
<p>But Bessie died without ever returning to Bays-
water. She died while the crowds stood in the hot
street before the Palazzo Gonfarini in Brinoe look-
ing up at the window where Miss Annie Spragg lay
dead.</p>
<p>SISTER ANNUNZIATA</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>S IGNORA BARDELLI, concierge of the Palazza
Gonfarini, had asked for Sister Annunziata and
she stood there firmly waiting until she got what she
wanted. It was always Sister Annunziata whom
they asked for when they wanted a nun to come to
the bedside of one of their dying. Sister Maria
Maddelena, who stood in the small square room fac-
ing the agitated janitress, was in her heart a proud
nun and when she thought ‚Äúthey‚Äù she meant all the
poor who lived in the decaying old rookeries in the
quarter about the Palazzo Gonfarini. Usually
‚Äúthey‚Äù asked for Sister Annunziata timidly but there
was no timidity in the bearing of the stalwart Sig-
nora Bardelli. Sister Maria Maddelena knew her
by reputation, a shrewd and a boastful woman, who
mocked priests and the Church. The sister, who
was human in her small way, could not resist mur-
muring, ‚ÄúBut you do not hold with the Church, Sig-
nora Bardelli.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is not for me,‚Äù said the janitress. ‚ÄúIt is for
the stranger living in my house. She is religious.‚Äù
She gave a shrug indicating that when she came to
die she would not call upon the hocus pocus of the
Church.</p>
<p>224 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>‚ÄúHer name?‚Äù asked Sister Maria Maddelena.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSignorina Spragg.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIs she a foreigner?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt seems so. I do not know where she came
from. She has lived with me for sixteen years.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd you don‚Äôt know anything about her?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe never talked. She did not speak much
Italian.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe has no money?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor three months she has not paid me anything.
She hasn‚Äôt any more money.‚Äù Signorina Bardeili
began to gesticulate. ‚ÄúWhat has all this got to do
with it? She is sick. She is out of her head. She
is dying, I cannot care for her and the whole house
as well. I want to see Sister Annunziata.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúSister Annunziata has just come in. She has
been staying with the wife of Carducci, the butcher,
who died two hours ago.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt will not matter to Sister Annunziata. Tell
her that Signora Bardeili wants to speak to her.‚Äù</p>
<p>She was stubborn because she was thinking that
she could not support the presence in her house of
any of the others. They would be asking things of
her and disturbing the other tenants. Besides she
distrusted nuns as meddlesome creatures, only Sis-
ter Annunziata was different. She told herself she
was not seeking aid from the Church. She was com-
ing for Sister Annunziata as for a friend. She
would not leave until she had seen her.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe old woman may be dying now while we‚Äôre
talking,‚Äù persisted the janitress, and then as if to
intimidate Sister Maria Maddelena she added
threateningly, ‚ÄúWithout absolution, without the last</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>225</p>
<p>rites of the dying. And that will be your fault for
delaying me. I will not leave till I talk to Sister
Annunziata. It will be on your head.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey‚Äù nearly always talked like this. It was
clear that the janitress was beginning to lose her
temper. Sister Maria Maddelena said, ‚ÄúWait,‚Äù
and disappeared through a little door behind the
table where she had been sitting, and Signora Bar-
delli, feeling she had put to rout the entire Church
of Rome, seated herself solemnly on a bench against
the grey wall beneath the solitary crucifix, a Christ
that W&rsquo;as elegant and prettified, half-clad in purple
and crimson garments with a crown of thorns that
was gilded.</p>
<p>When the door opened again Sister Maria Mad-
delena was followed by a tall malformed figure who
was forced to stoop a little to pass through the arch-
way. It was Sister Annunziata. She was rather a
grotesque than a woman and her ugliness made her
seem no age at all, although you would have guessed
that she was forty-five. She had high cheek-bones
and a long enormous nose and one eye turned out-
ward a little so that it was impossible to know when
she was looking at you. Her great hands hung sus-
pended from fantastically long arms. The nun‚Äôs
dress suited her better than any other. One is not
taught to look for beauty as the first quality of a
nun. She seemed pale and tired.</p>
<p>At sight of her Signora Bardelli rose politely
and greeted her. The manner of open hostility
melted away. She told her story ‚Äî ^how the strange
old woman who had lived with her for sixteen years
was iU and perhaps dying. Signora Bardelli had</p>
<p>226</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>found her in her bed unconscious when she failed to
appear during the day. She was fond of the old
woman. She had grown used to her. Sister
Annunziata knew her. It was the old woman who
dressed so queerly and ran about the streets of
Brinoe in all weathers.</p>
<p>She talked rapidly and with excitement w&rsquo;hile
Sister Annunziata listened. The gaunt nun had a
curious air of humility as if she wanted desperately
to please, not only Sister Maria Maddelena but
even the janltress.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI will come,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf she is dying we must
fetch a priest. Is she a believer? In the true
faith?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI do not know,‚Äù said the janltress. ‚ÄúShe goes
often to the church, mostly to San Giovanni. She is
devout and religious.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI will come,‚Äù repeated Sister Annunziata in her
deep masculine voice. She turned and disappeared
through the doorway, leaving the janltress to savor
her triumph over Sister Maria Maddelena. In a
moment she returned with a small bag. Without
another word the two women set out through the
dark, narrow streets. As they stepped through the
doorway the wind from Africa blew into their faces
like the wind out of an oven. They made haste, for
Sister Annunziata had another soul upon her con-
science. She walked with the stride of a man, her
big feet and long legs covering in one step the dis-
tance covered by two steps of the stout short
janltress. The streets were empty and they passed
no one all the way to the gloomy archway that was
the entrance to the ruined Palazzo Gonfarini.</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>227</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>It was a quarter in which Sister Annunziata knew
every door and every window, every cornice. She
knew even the holes in the pavement, which had
never been repaired in the twenty-nine years she had
spent going from house to house where she was
needed. She did not, like Sister Maria Maddelena,
think in secret pride of these poor sleeping all about
her as ‚Äúthey.‚Äù To Sister Annunziata this was all
of the world, its beginning and its end. She had
lived in it so long, absorbed by its pain and sorrows,
that she had long ago forgotten she had ever be-
longed in any other. She had forgotten too because
this life had been happy and the other had never
held any happiness.</p>
<p>She quite forgot that she was born Eugenia Bea-
trice d‚ÄôOrobelli. Among the poor it was said that
she belonged to a proud family, but long ago ‚Äúthey‚Äù
too had forgotten, if they ever knew, what she had
been in the world. She was simply Sister Annun-
ziata whom ‚Äúthey‚Äù always asked for. Sometimes
they called her, behind her back. The Ugly One, and
sometimes The Mad One, but there was in both
names a kind of afiection of that simple quality which
colors the feelings of the humble.</p>
<p>In twenty-nine years she had seen none of her
family save Faustino, her only brother, and him she
had seen only twice when he had come from Vente-
rollo with family papers for her to sign. She knew
that he had married an American woman and she
knew that he had three sons, one of whom, the
eldest, was an invalid and lived always with his</p>
<p>228 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>father at Venterollo. Faustino had troubled him-
self to write her these things, but from her sisters
and from her mother and father, who were long
since dead, she had heard nothing. When they put
her into a convent at sixteen they had forgotten her
as if she had never existed. Afterwards her mother
in speaking of her family spoke of ‚Äúmy son and five
daughters,‚Äù as if Eugenia Beatrice had never existed
at all. As a little girl she had never been allowed to
see visitors who came to Venterollo. She was
always kept out of sight with the gardener‚Äôs wife in
the little house by the river.</p>
<p>So as a child she had played alone most of the
time because she was years younger than her sisters
and because they were proud and showed her that
they did not want her about them. She had come to
make friends with the birds and the animals in the
park of Venterollo and to spend her days like a wild
thing under the ancient oaks and moss-grown decay-
ing walls.</p>
<p>She was twelve years old when she understood
what it was that caused them all to treat her dif-
ferently. She had been sitting quietly one day on a
little copse near the ruined pavilion watching a troop
of ants building a city, when she heard voices, which
she recognized as those of her mother and of her
aunt. They were devout women who went every
day to mass, and that day because it was hot they
had stopped on their way home to rest in the pa-
vilion. Her mother was crying because there was
no money to marry off her five daughters. Two
were already grown and on their way to being old
maids. Her husband had only debts and would not</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>229</p>
<p>give up gambling and her son of twenty was wild
and always in trouble with women. But worst of
all and hardest to bear was Eugenia Beatrice. Why
had God sent her another daughter late in life?
And why had He sent her such a little monster who
was as ugly as if she had been the daughter of the
Devil himself? Nobody w&rsquo;ould ever marry such
an ugly creature even with a dot of a million lira.
What chance would she have without a penny?
Why had she, a good woman, been punished thus?</p>
<p>There was nothing to be done with Eugenia
Beatrice, said her aunt, but to put her into a con-
vent as soon as possible. Even there a creature $0
ugly was certain to frighten the other nuns.</p>
<p>That night Eugenia Beatrice did not return from
the park. They searched for her, not too carefully,
for there was no one who really wanted to find her,
but at evening of the next day she was brought home
by a peasant living on the side of the mountain
fifteen miles away. He had found her shivering
among the rocks when he went out with his goats in
the early morning.</p>
<p>Ill</p>
<p>As the two women passed through the great
arched doorway of the Palazzo Gonfarini, the jam-
tress went ahead leading the way up the wide stone
stairwmy. It was cool here, for the thick walls shut
out the hot wind that sang so perversely along the
ancient cornices. At the second turning of the stair-
way, Signora Bardelli opened a door and they found
themselves in a long corridor with a row of cell-</p>
<p>230</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>like doors opening along one side. It was lighted
by a single jet of flickering gas. The whole space
had once been the great banqueting hall of the palace
but years before it had been filled in thus with parti-
tions and converted into a kind of rookery by the
grandfather of Father d‚ÄôAstier, who now o%vned the
palace. At the end of the corridor the janitress
turned and knocked and the two women stepped into
a small square room like a long box turned on end.
It was not more than ten by twelve feet in size, but
it was high, so high that in the dim glow of the night
light floating in a bowl of cheap blue pottery the ceil-
ing would have been lost in shadow save for the
occasional glint struck by the light against the
ancient gilding of the painted beams. As they
entered there arose a flutter and commotion from a
great number of tiny birds which rose from the end
of the bed where they had been perching and cir-
cled blindly about until one by one they settled on
the rows of cages hung against the grey wail. In
one corner there was a narrow iron bed and on it
lay the dying woman, a coarse poor sheet drawn up
to her chin.</p>
<p>She was quite still and lay on her back with her
eyes closed. It was a curious face, neither old nor
young, not beautiful and yet fascinating by the per-
fection of its modelling. It was the first time any-
one save Signora Bardelli had ever seen the face
without the hat and the thick veil. Great masses
of red hair lay on the pillow. In front it was cut
short in a long fringe that hid completely the fore-
head.</p>
<p>For a moment Sister Annunziata stood by the side</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>231 ‚Ä¢</p>
<p>of the narrow bed looking down at Miss Annie
Spragg and then slowly, almost as if she was uncon-
scious of the gesture, one of the gaunt ugly hands
touched the beautiful hair with a curious gesture
of reverence.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe is not an old woman,‚Äù said Sister Annun-
ziata.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe was like that when she came to me,‚Äù said
the janitress. ‚ÄúShe cannot be young. She has been
here for fifteen years. She has not changed much.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then Sister Annunziata touched the bi&rsquo;ow, gently
pushing back a little the thick fringe of hair. Then
she listened to the breathing and while Signora Bar-
delli held the night light she bent over to look at the
pale, tired eyelids.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe is dying,‚Äù said Sister Annunziata. ‚ÄúYou
had better go for Father Baldessare. I will stay
with her.‚Äù She knew all the signs. For twenty-
five years she had sat at the side of the dying.</p>
<p>So the janitress went away again out into the hot
night and Sister Annunziata closed the great shut-
ters against the heat of the African wind. When
she had done this she set about putting the room in
order, lifting the bedraggled tweed suit and the bat-
tered old picture hat and veil from the only chair in
the room. Then she sat by the side of the bed and
reaching beneath the sheet felt the wrist of Miss
Annie Spragg and knelt beside the bed to pray. It
was not to God that she prayed or to the Vir^n, but
to Saint Francis of the Birds. He was her saint.
He was more than that. He was to Sister Annun-
ziata the only God who had ever existed. She
prayed for a long time, commending to his care the</p>
<p>232 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>soul of the dying woman. The souls of all the
dying she commended to the care of Saint Francis.
He was saint whom she adored since she was a
little girl.</p>
<p>At last she arose and opening the little bag she
brought with her took out a powder which she dis-
solved in water and swallowed. Sister Annunziata
was ill herself. Lately she had reached the age
when her body was sometimes racked with pain and
her mind seemed vague and confused and clouded.
Twice lately she had had visions in which she saw
Saint Francis far off in the midst of a bright field
filled with little daisies and primroses. He ap-
peared to be beckoning to her but he came no nearer.
He was the simple Saint Francis of Giotto‚Äôs picture
that hung in her room years ago at Venterollo.
Lately she prayed at times to him for some miracu-
lous sign of his approbation. She prayed that Saint
Francis would show her a sign of his love. &hellip;</p>
<p>After bending once more over the sick woman she
seated herself by the bed and took out of her bag a
little worn leather-bound copy of The Little Flowers
of Saint Francis and began to read. Once she had
known it all by heart but lately with her trouble she
seemed unable to remember the verses in their
proper order. She was forced to hold the book
close to her face in the dim light because her eyes
were weak and swollen.</p>
<p>As she sat reading the little birds, who had been
watching her with bright eyes from the tops of the
cages, appeared to lose their fear and flew down in
small confused groups of two and three to perch
once more on the foot of; the iron bed.</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>233</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>On the day that Eugenia Beatrice was sixteen her
aunt took her dressed all in black to enter the con-
yent They kissed each other good-by coldly, since
the aunt had no affection for her and the child had
long ago ceased to look for any affection from the
world. The door closed and the great ugly girl
found herself among the sisters, shrinking and
frightened as she had always been in the presence of
strangers. They stared at her as intently as if
they believed there could be no creature so ugly in
all the world.</p>
<p>From that day on her life was given over to pleas-
ing others in the vague half-formed hope that out
of her service there would grow some reward of
commendation or affection. She scrubbed the floors
and swept the vast hallway and took upon herself
the meanest tasks, and sometimes there would be a
reward, a word of praise from one of the nuns or
even the Mother Superior herself. She knelt for
long hours on the cold stone floor praying to Saint
Francis who had love for all living things and so
might love her as w^eli, even if God had made her so
ugly that she frightened people. For in the great
awkward body there was a soul so hungry for love
that it would have given itself over to torture and
slavery for the sake of anyone who had for her a
kind word. But her ugliness was so great that the
other sisters, almost without knowing it, thought of
her as something grotesque and strange and different
from themselves.</p>
<p>For three years she lived thus and at last when</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>234</p>
<p>she went out into the city to care for the sick and the
poor she began for the first time to find her place in
the world and to forget her childhood. Among the
wretched she went about with that same humble
manner of supplication, seeking to please them in
return for kindliness. She entered their squalid
houses as a creature unworthy of serving them. She
sat at the bedside of old men dying of loathsome dis-
eases and young mothers who died bearing their first
children. She sat by young and handsome men cut
off in the midst of life and risked her life by the
side of children ill with smallpox and scarlet fever.
She ate what the poor ate and slept as they slept,
asking nothing of them in return but a word of kind-
ness. And even the young men who loved only
youth and the joy of being alive and the feel-
ing of the hot blood in their veins came in the
end to find a strange kind of beauty in the presence
of sister Annunziata. It was an unearthly beauty
that seemed less concerned with the ugly body and
face of Sister Annunziata than with all that sur-
rounded her. With her by their side even the young
found death quiet and peaceful. They loved the
gentleness of the huge misshapen hands. A kind of
light seemed to flow from the ugly face.</p>
<p>And she knew sometimes that they called her The
Ugly One and The Mad One and she smiled to her-
self and was glad because they would not have called
her such names if there had not been affection in
their hearts. In a way her body came to exist no
longer save as an instrument to serve her spirit.
She came, unlike other women, to cherish it not as an
instrument of love or of beauty but as something</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>235</p>
<p>that was useful to her. When at forty-five it began
to fail her she prayed desperately to Saint Francis to
give her strength. It was not death that she feared
but the thought that her body‚Äôs failing her might
shut her off from all those who called her The Ugly
One and The Mad One. Saint Francis could help
her, whom she loved with all her soul.</p>
<p>Sitting by the bed of Miss Annie Spragg she read,
holding the page close to her weak swollen eyes ;</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen Saint Francis drew nigh unto Bevagna he
came unto a spot wherein a great multitude of birds
of divers species were gathered together. When
the holy man of God perceived them he ran with all
speed unto the place and greeted them as if they had
shared in human understanding. They on their
part all awaited him and turned toward him, those
that were perched on the bushes bending their heads
as he drew nigh them, and looking on him in un-
wonted wise while he came right among them, and
diligently exhorted them, all to hear the word of
God, saying, ‚ÄòMy brothers the birds, much ought
ye to praise your Creator, who hath clothed you with
feathers and given you wings to fly, and hath made
over unto you the pure air, and careth for you with-
out your taking thought for yourselves.‚Äô While he
was speaking these and other like words, the little
birds ‚Äî behaving themselves in wondrous wise ‚Äî ^be-
gan to stretch their necks, to open their beaks, and
to look intently upon him. He, with wondrous fer-
vor of spirit, passed in&rsquo; and out among them, touch-
ing them with his habit, nor did one 6f them move
from the spot until he had made the sign of the</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>236</p>
<p>cross over them and given them leave ; then with the
blessing of the man of God, they all flew away to-
gether. All these things were witnessed by his com-
panions who stood awaiting him by the way. Re-
turning unto them, the simple and holy man began
to blame himself for neglect in that he not afore then
preached unto the birds. . .</p>
<p>The little birds were quite still now and sat in a
row on the end of the bed, some with eyes closed,
some watching Sister Annnunziata with their bright
eyes.</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>It was nearly dawn when she was aroused by the
sound of creaking boots in the corridor. It was
Father Baldessare. She knew the sound of his
boots. He was a humble simple priest who had
come many times to the homes of the poor in re-
sponse to her summons. His boots always creaked.
The door opened and he came in, fat and short with
a red pimply face, followed by Signora BardeUi.
They were both hot and panting from the long walk
through the hot wind and the climb up the great
stone stairway. As they entered the room the birds
fluttered up again to their cages and the woman on
the bed opened her eyes a little way slowly and with
the greatest effort. For a moment they were dark-
ened by a strange look of terror in them as if she
thought herself already dead and was awakening in
a dark world of black-robed nuns and priests. And
then she appeared to recognize Sister Annunziata</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>&lsquo;237</p>
<p>and the look of fear faded away. She could not
speak. Her lips were frozen.</p>
<p>Sister Annunziata made a gesture dismissing the
janitress and then turned to the fat little priest.
‚Äò‚ÄòWe had better make haste,‚Äù she murmured. ‚ÄúI
will stay and hold her up. She cannot raise her
own body.‚Äù</p>
<p>And so they made ready to offer Miss Annie
Spragg the last service they could give her on this
earth and when Father Baldessare, after much pant-
ing and sweating, was ready Sister Annunziata
knelt beside the bed and lifted the dying woman,
resting the thin helpless body against her own gaunt
shoulder. They found then that her hands were
covered by white cotton gloves and w^hen Father
Baldessare tried to remove them a kind of convul-
sion shook her and into her eyes there came a look
so terrible that Sister Annunziata understood her
plea and they left her hands covered.</p>
<p>The fat little priest began to read the lines and
administer the Sacrament and once more the little
birds, no longer fearful, fluttered down one by one
to the iron rail at the foot of the bed and sat in a
row. The look of fear left the eyes of the dying
wmman and slowly the eyelids drooped with weari-
ness.</p>
<p>When at last Father Baldessare had finished, the
eyes opened a little way and again a look of plead-
ing came into them. Then slowly in a kind of agony
Annie Spragg lifted her right arm a little way and
made a faint vague gesture which only Sister Annun-
ziata understood. Still supporting the dying woman
the nun leaned down and took from the chair the</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>23S</p>
<p>copy of The Little Flowers of Saint Francis and
from her bag she took the stub of a worn blue pen-
cil. She put the pencil in Annie Spragg‚Äôs hand and
opening the book held It for her to -write. Slowly
and with pain the dying woman scrawled seven
words and when she had finished the pencil dropped
from her hands and the eyelids drooped again.
There wzs a faint sigh filled with weariness and Sis-
ter Annunziata commended her soul to the care of
Saint Francis of the Birds.</p>
<p>They laid her back upon the bed and Sister An-
nunziata opened the page where she had written.
At first she could make nothing of the scrawl and
peered at it for a long time with her swollen red
eyes. Then slowly she understood It. The old
woman had written,</p>
<p>Open the window. Let them be free.</p>
<p>When Father Baldessare loosened the hea\7-
shutters the first faint color of dawn had begun to
rise behind the mountains and the rosy grey light
was filtering down among the ancient ghost-filled
houses that surrounded the Palazzo Gonfarini. As
he stood there for a moment looking out into the
hot empty street there was a faint rushing sound all
about him. It was the little birds flying past him,
chirping and twittering, into the rising dawn. The
air was filled with the sound of wings.</p>
<p>After Father Baldessare had gone again, Sister
Annunziata drew the sheet over the face of the dead
woman and closing the door gently behind her went
down the long corridor and the great stone stairway
to seek a bowl of hot coffee. She needed It in order
to keep her weary eyes open any longer and she</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>^39</p>
<p>could not ask Signora BardeUi to fetch It, for Sig-
nora Bardeili was a busy woman and had been up
most of the night. The hallway and the cortile
were grey blue with morning light and already out
of the celi-like doors there had begun to appear
figures which Sister Annunziata knew well . . . the
I old man who washed the streets, the blind old</p>
<p>I woman who sold flowers in the arcades of the Piazza</p>
<p>I Vittorio Emanuele, Galeazzo the lame stone cutter.</p>
<p>[ They greeted her knowing that her presence In the</p>
<p>Palazzo Gonfarini meant that there was suffering
and death within its walls. She understood what it
was they wanted to know. It was the stranger, she
told them, who lived at the far end of the corridor.
They crossed themselves and wished good health
I to Sister Annunziata and peace to the soul of the</p>
<p>; dead woman.</p>
<p>5 In a little while she returned bringing v/ith her</p>
<p>! candles and a great kettle of hot water and when she</p>
<p>I had entered the room again she set about placing it</p>
<p>in order. She went through the drav^ers of the
cheap pine table and the pockets of the grey tweed
i suit but she found nothing. There were no papers</p>
<p>i and not even a lira in money. The dead woman</p>
<p>I appeared to have no possessions but the clothes she</p>
<p>5 wore and the little birds.</p>
<p>Then Sister Annunziata went to the iron bed and
lifted the sheet and for a long time she stood look-
ing down at Miss Annie Spragg. The lines of pain
had gone out of the dead face, leaving it transparent
I and smooth and peaceful against the masses of</p>
<p>;; splendid tangled hair. Again Sister Annunziata,</p>
<p>who had a way of talking to herself, murmured,</p>

<p>could not ask Signora Bardelli to fetch it, for Sig-

most of the night The hallway and the cortile
were grey blue with morning light and already out
of the celi-Iike doors there had begun to appear
figures which Sister Annunziata knew well . . . the

<p>In a little while she returned bringing with her
candles and a great kettle of hot water and when she
had entered the room again she set about placing it
in order. She went through the drawers of the
cheap pine table and the pockets of the grey tweed
suit but she found nothing. There w^ere no papers
and not even a lira in money. The dead woman
appeared to have no possessions but the clothes she
wore and the little birds.</p>
<p>Then Sister Annunziata went to the iron bed and
lifted the sheet and for a long time she stood look-
ing down at Miss Annie Spragg. The lines of pain
had gone out of the dead face, leaving it transparent
and smooth and peaceful against the masses of
splendid tangled hair. Again Sister Annunziata,
who had a way of talking to herself, murmured,</p>
<p>240</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut she is not an old woman.‚Äù And once more
the great bony hand reached out with a gesture of
reverence and envy to touch the beauty of the dead
woman‚Äôs hair.</p>
<p>As she set about her task with dim near-sighted
eyes, she saw that the body of the dead woman was
not old and that it was beautifully made and that in
youth it had been superb. She saw that it was a
body which perhaps had known the love which was
shut out forever from the life of a nun. She had
seen bodies many times that were young and splendid
even in death when it was no longer wrong to look
upon their nakedness, and each time it gave her a
kind of twisting, sickening pain, so that in the end
she had come to look away from them.</p>
<p>As she worked with averted eyes she tried to re-
peat the psalms she had learned as a child at Vente-
rollo, but in her trouble and in the pain that racked
her body and the clouds that obscured her thoughts
she could not remember them. \Yhen she had
nearly finished her task she discovered that she had
not removed the white cotton gloves that covered
the hands. She removed first one and then the
other and then quite suddenly she made the discov-
ery. On the palm of each hand there was a red
scar as if both hands had been pierced by nails. For
a moment she stared in silence, leaning close in order
to see, and then gently, with a gesture almost of
terror, she pushed back the fringe of hair that cov-
ered the brow of the dead woman, and there on the
brow she discovered other scars as if a crown of
thorns had been pressed upon her head. There was</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>241</p>
<p>a great livid scar in the side and the two feet had
the marks of nails.</p>
<p>For a second a vicious pain racked her body and
a blinding light dazzled her poor weak eyes and then
without a sound she slipped to the floor unconscious.
For she had seen the Stigmata, It was the sign of
Saint Francis of the Birds.</p>
<p>When Signora Bardelli climbed the stone stairs an
hour later she found that all the birds had flown
from the room and that Sister Annunziata lay un-
conscious on the floor*. And on the bed lay the
naked body of the dead woman bearing in Its flesh
the scars of the Crucifixion. The room was quite
light now and the brilliant morning sun streamed in
at the open window.</p>
<p>For the only time in her life Signora Bardelli was
frightened. She felt a sudden wild impulse to fail
upon her knees and pray to the very saints she had
mocked. She had a strange fear of being watched
by something which she could neither see nor under-
stand.</p>
<p>She seemed unable to revive the unconscious nun
and when Father Baldessare returned creaking and
sweating along the corridor he found her still kneel-
ing beside the prostrate figure. He too saw the
miraculous scars on the body of the dead woman and
knelt humbly in prayer by the side of the bed.</p>
<p>When at last Sister Annunziata opened her eyes,
she seemed for a long time unable to speak. They
gave her sour wine to drink and at last she told
them a strange and muddled story. She said that
as she stood over the body a great and blinding light
had appeared on the wall opposite the bed and that</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>242</p>
<p>in the midst of it stood Saint Francis in a tiny field
of buttercups and primroses, surrounded by all the
little birds that a little time before had fluttered
about the room. From his body there streamed
great rays of light. These appeared to come from
his hands and his feet, his side and his brow, where
there were wounds like those of Our Lord. The
light streamed toward the body of the dead woman.
After that she could remember no more.</p>
<p>As she told the story a strange unearthly look of
happy madness came into her face, so that even the
hard Signora Bardelli felt a sudden awe.</p>
<p>Before noon the story of the miracle had traveled
through all the quarter and crowds came streaming
into the cortile, up the staircase and along the corri-
dor. Pushing and crying out hysterically, women
thrust themselves into the chamber of the dead
woman and there tore her clothes and the very chair
and table into bits as relics. They bore off the cages
of the little birds, and the night light, and one
woman soaked her shawl In the water that was in
the bowl of cheap blue crockery. In their hunger
for relics they snatched the bedraggled roses from
the old picture hat and ripped bits from the very
sheet that covered the body of Miss Spragg, until
only torn fragments remained to hide its nakedness.
It was the police who at last cleared them from the
house, pushing them rudely back into the street.
But the crowd would not go away. It hung about
the great arched gateway of the Palazzo Gonfarini
and women knelt in the dust to pray beneath the
windows.</p>
<p>Through all the confusion and the vulgar turrnoll</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>243</p>
<p>Sister Annunziata went about calmly, with that
strange new light of happiness in her face. She
was loved at last. Saint Francis had sent her the
sign.</p>
<p>CODA</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>O N THE morning following Mr. Winnery‚Äôs ex-
traordinary attack of romanticism he awakened
slowly and lay abed for a long time after the goit-
ered Maria, maidservant of twenty years, had come
in and flung open the shutters. He awakened con-
scious that he was feeling exceedingly weU and freed
of the usual torpor caused by the combination of a
bad liver and the wretched climate of Brinoe. He
was aware that the wind from Africa had died out
altogether and that in its place there was a cool
fresh breeze that changed the brilliant sun; and blue
sky from a nightmare Into a delight. It was odd, he
thought, how well he felt, considering that he had
been up walking the streets on the night before
until after midnight. It occurred to. him that per-
haps you could break habits without inviting calami-
ties. Perhaps breaking habits made life more excit-
ing. It was a thing he had never tried before ‚Äî
this exciting way of living.</p>
<p>And then his eye fell upon the telegram, and he
suddenly felt even happier. He remembered that
now he could leave Brinoe forever. He would not
have to be buried in the Protestant cemetery, among
all the people who had bored him for twenty years.
He would not have to rest through all eternity</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>244</p>
<p>beside someone like old Mrs. Whitehead. He could
now travel everywhere and anyvrhere, always seek-
ing with the bright hope of an incurable romantic
some spot that would be as paradisiacal as it was
reported to be by poets and old ladies and tourist
circulars. Aunt Bessie was dead, God bless her.</p>
<p>He rose, and before doing the exercises which
kept his waist measure within moderation, and his
liver in action, he went to the window and looked
out. Below him in the little square the usual things
were going on. There were bony horses and cab
drivers in varnished leather hats, three English
ladies in tweeds and picture hats, armed with um-
brellas, Baedekers and cameras. An elderly Amer-
ican couple reading out of a book about the tower
of the church opposite. They read a paragraph
and then regarded the tower again, as if uncertain
which things had been regarded by Mr. Ruskin as
beautiful and which things had not. A brown-robed
monk came down from the high monastery of Monte
Salvatore. A herd of goats with the shepherd in
a black smock playing a tune on a strange pipe held
in the hollow of his hand. A Ford automobile with
nine Italians. Though it was early morning they
were dressed in full evening clothes, clearly bound
for a wedding or a christening. A woman leaned
out of a window and screamed at the goatherd. He
halted the flock, put away the pipe and set himself
industriously to milking one of the she-goats.</p>
<p>It was a delightful place, after all, Brinoe. Per-
haps It wasn‚Äôt as bad as he had thought. Now that
he was rich he could keep a larger apartment and
have a villa somewhere in the hiUs. Suddenly it</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 245</p>
<p>occurred to him that it must be later than he thought
and regarding the tower opposite he discovered
that it was already ten o‚Äôclock. It couldn‚Äôt be as
late as that. The clock was Italian and therefore
probably an hour or two wrong. It was never cor-
rect with the sun, and to Italians such things didn‚Äôt
matter. But his own watch showed him that the
clock was not fast (which he knew would be unusual
In Brinoe), but slow by half an hour. It was half
past ten. Maria had not called him and for the
first time in twenty years he had overslept. For a
moment he experienced a wild desire to summon
Maria and abuse her, but something about the
square, the sky and the sight of the wedding party In
the Ford made him soften. He decided to do noth-
ing about Maria‚Äôs dereliction. It was odd, indeed,
how well he felt, and how young and spry.</p>
<p>Then he saw coming round the tower of the
church the tall awkward figure of a nun, walking in
great haste, her full black skirt swinging with her
masculine stride. ‚ÄúIt is the crazy one,‚Äô‚Äô he thought,
‚ÄúSister Annunziata.‚Äù As she crossed the little
square toward his house, he saw that she was smiling
and talking to herself in the most animated fashion
as she walked. She turned and disappeared
through the archway by the old Palace of the
Podestas.</p>
<p>The sight of her brought to mind Miss Annie
Spragg. Well, it was an interesting case and he
would have to go further into it. If he continued
in his present health and spirits he would be able
to complete ‚ÄúMiracles and Other Natural Phe-
nomena‚Äù within a year or two. He must see Mrs.</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>246</p>
<p>Weatherby again and go further into the history of
Miss Spragg at a time when they would not be inter-
rupted by the presence of such frivolous and worldly
people as Father d‚ÄôAstier and the d‚ÄôOrobelli woman.</p>
<p>At that moment he saw the black and red motor
swing from under the archway and cross the square.
In it were the Princess d‚ÄôOrobelli and a man whom
he did not know, a dark handsome man who was
not Father d‚ÄôAstier. ‚ÄúAh,‚Äù thought Mr. Winnery,
with a sudden warm feeling of being a worldly devil,
‚Äúthat is why she is in Brinoe at this time of year.
That is it &hellip; a lover. A rendezvous.‚Äù It made
him feel almost a gay dog.</p>
<p>It made him also think, ‚ÄúIf she is not too old for
love, neither am I. A man lasts much longer than
a woman.‚Äù And that in turn made him think of
Miss Fosdick and reflect again that now he was rich
he could do anything he pleased. With money you
could buy anything. Perhaps he might rescue
Miss Fosdick from the dragon‚Äôs den and marry her.
Now that he was rich he would have to upset a good
many habits and upsetting habits it seemed did not
bring disaster. On the contrary, he never felt bet-
ter. . . . Dear me, it was an odd world.</p>
<p>He decided that he would hire the fiacre once
more and drive out to the Villa Leonardo before
making up his mind entirely about Miss Fosdick.
It was a pleasant day and the drive would be re-
freshing. He could wring more information from
Mrs. Weatherby, if he could prevent her long
enough from talking about herself. And perhaps
he could have a word alone with Miss Fos-
dick. He might ask permission to call upon her.</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 247</p>
<p>Yes, he would need a wife now that he was rich.
But he must be cautious. At fifty-three one had no
time to indulge in mistakes.</p>
<p>He tried to pretend to himself that he was being
merely practical and not at all sentimental, but at
the same time he experienced again that pleasant
tickling sensation of satisfaction over his interest in
her. It was no more than the shadow of desire. It
flattered him that there was a certain . . . well,
grossness &hellip; in the feeling. He had a most
stimulating awareness of adventure.</p>
<p>The door opened and fat Maria came in, looking,
decided Mr. Winnery, as if she had swallowed a
canary. That, thought Winnery, is because she has
been guilty of a dereliction of duty and expects a
scolding.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBuon giorno,‚Äù he said brightly. ‚ÄúBuon giorno.‚Äù</p>
<p>Maria looked somewhat astonished. Feeling a
little encouraged to gossip, she asked if Signor Win-
nery had heard the latest about Signorina Spragg.
Miss Annie Spragg was being buried today and the
burial was causing the local church authorities a
great deal of trouble and uncertainty. The question
was a purely technical one. No one could decide
whether the miraculous scars should be officially
recognized as a miracle and the body of Miss Annie
Spragg considered as that of a potential saint or
whether she ought to be treated simply with the con-
ventional respect due a devout follower of the
Church. There was even a party among the more
bigoted older priests which held that there was not
even any proof that she was a Roman Catholic and
that it was not proper to defile consecrated ground</p>
<p>248 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>with the body of a heretic. And there was always
that ancient decree of Pope Sixtus IV Issued against
Saint Catherine of Siena, Sixtus IV holding that
the miracle of the Stigmata was the exclusive monop-
oly of Saint Francis and that it was a censurable
ofiense to report It of anyone else. The whole
thing threatened to grow into a scandal. Miss
Ajinie Spragg had no money, so Sister Annunziata
was paying for the funeral. Did Mr. Winnery know
who Sister Annunziata really was? Well, it turned
out that she was born the Princess d‚ÄôOrobelll, and
she was put into a convent because her family saw
no chance of ever marrying off so ugly a woman.</p>
<p>Maria paused for breath and then went on. Had
Signor Winnery heard about Father Baldessare, that
little fat priest attached to San Giovanni? Yes, the
one who had witnessed the miracle and found Sis-
ter Annunziata lying senseless after she had been
visited by Saint Francis. Well, Father Baldessare
had left the Church and was going from town to
town, on foot, to preach in the market places. He
was going to purify Christianity, she said, and begin
all over again. That was a silly idea. How could
there be any Christianity without the Church?
Wasn‚Äôt the Church Christianity?</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe has always been a little cracked,‚Äù she said,
‚Äúand now he seems gone out of his mind.‚Äù</p>
<p>She had heard all this at the market. ‚ÄúAh,‚Äù
thought Winnery, who had quite forgotten that he
was still clad only in an Italian night shirt, em-
broidered in red cotton, ‚Äúno wonder she was late.‚Äù</p>
<p>Maria walked to the window on the opposite side
of the room and stood looking down into the market.</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>249</p>
<p>‚ÄúLook,‚Äù she said, pointing down. ‚ÄúThere he is
now.‚Äù</p>
<p>Winnery crossed over to the window. In one
corner of the market by the fountain of dolphins
and serpents there was a crowd of cooks and cham-
bermaids and cab drivers. On the edge stood the
three English ladies with the Baedekers, umbrellas
and cameras. One had placed her hand behind her
ear in order to hear more distinctly. They sur-
rounded a fat short figure clad in a brightly checked
suit of the kind affected in London by bookmakers.
In one hand the figure held an umbrella. The other
hand was being used in emphatic but ineffective ges-
tures. The crowd stood staring up at him, amused
and astonished, but aware that it was being
treated to an entertainment which cost nothing.
The speaker‚Äôs voice was weak and shrill so that it
did not carry above the tumult of excited bargaining
that was in progress on all sides. After a time the
cooks began to drift away one by one to buy their
leeks and spinach and potatoes. It was Father
Baldessare, turned to plain Fulco Baldessare, leader
of the new reformation.</p>
<p>Winnery, watching the spectacle, had a swift fleet-
ing vision of humanity struggling to extricate itself
from some colossal muddle. Then he returned to
his breakfast, which he ate with a hearty appetite.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>From the moment of Miss Fosdick‚Äôs hysterical
flight into the great world life began to annoy Mrs.
Weatherby. For twenty years she had managed fo</p>
<p>250 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>subdue its annoyances because dear Gertrude had
seen to every tiresome detail‚Äî the packing, ordering
the food, shipping trunks, buying tickets, giving or-
ders timidly to servants ‚Äî ^in short, doing all the
things which might have broken in upon the spiritual
quiet of the Great Religious Experimenter. It had
become a system so thorough and so monotonous
that Mrs. Weatherby had quite forgotten the grey ex-
istence of such troublesome details. Now that her
slave was gone, her life collapsed about her ears in
a confusion of petty annoyances.</p>
<p>Margharita wanted to know what Giovanni
should bring from the market. The men who were
building a cesspool found that the cement was of
the wrong kind. Should Giovanni buy a new tire
for the Ford? Lulu, the elder Pomeranian, spit up
her breakfast. There was no more sunflower seed
for Anubis. It was as if Mrs. Weatherby‚Äôs star
had slipped into some profoundly disastrous con-
junction. She remembered with terror that her
horoscope foretold disaster and disappointments
during the six months beginning with August.</p>
<p>And she was forced to face and solve all these
calamities while sufiering the greatest anguish of
mind. Had she not been betrayed by the one crea-
ture on whom for twenty years she had lavished the
wealth of affection and kindness of a mother? For
twenty years she had been harboring an ingrate,
nay, a viper, at her bosom. She kept saying this
over and over again to herself while she squabbled
with Margharita and dosed Lulu with castor oil.
And all those cruel things which Gertrude had said
the night before. She must have been thinking</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 251.</p>
<p>them in secret for years while she lived on the bounty
of her doting Aunt Henrietta. And to go away
without a word, not even telling her Aunt Henrietta
she had gone.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut she will return,‚Äù she kept telling herself.
‚ÄúShe will return in good time, perhaps today, per-
haps tomorrow. What is there for her to do but to
return?‚Äù</p>
<p>And when she returned she would be more con-
trollable than before. After her ingratitude and
treachery she would seek to do penance. Perhaps
it would be better in the end. If there was a divine
law, people suffered for such behavior.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI must not think evil thoughts,‚Äù she told her-
self, ‚Äúbecause evil thoughts make us old and tired
and bring on the twilight.‚Äù</p>
<p>No, she would be sweet and forgiving when
Gertrude returned; sweet and forgiving, she re-
peated to herself, but firm as well. She must not
give in too easily.</p>
<p>Suddenly it occurred to her that her misfortune
might have to do with the strange statue found in
the cesspool. From the very beginning she had
disliked it as an obscene and disturbing thing, and
now since Miss Fosdick was gone and there was no
other object at hand on which to vent her ill temper
she began to hate the statue. There was no doubt
that such an image aroused the lower nature. It
was perhaps the sight of it that had caused Gertrude
to behave in so idiotic a fashion with the Duke of
Fonterrabia. Perhaps It was the statue that had
driven her to run off like a madwoman. She might,
she thought, give the statue to a museum, or, what</p>
<p>252 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>‚Ä¢was better still, she might bury it again, even deeper
than it had been before. Yes, that -w^as it. She
would have the workmen bury it once more, and then
Gertrude would return and Lulu would recover and
all these troubles would disappear. Perhaps it was
silly to think such things, but you could never tell
about superstitions. Sometimes they were quite
right. She would not have the thing about leaning
against the ilex, watching everything that passed in
the garden.</p>
<p>Presently she began to worry again about the
Annie Spragg affair. Isolated there on the side of
the mountain she could not discover what was hap-
pening, nor (what would have been the most valu-
able of all knowledge ) the attitude the Church was
taking toward the miracle. She was aware that she
must discover this before she spoke again to Father
d‚ÄôAstier. If the Church looked upon Annie Spragg
as an imposter then she must wash her hands of
Annie Spragg and support the Church by telling all
the dark things she knew about Annie Spragg. If
the Church chose to regard the affair in the light
of a miracle then she must espouse the cause of Miss
Annie Spragg and appear as her friend. It was all
perplexing enough without having the ungrateful
Gertrude (disappear just when she was most needed.</p>
<p>At noon she ate nothing but retired to her room
for a siesta. In her agitation she had not closed an
eye all night. More than that, Gertrude had not
been there to will away the currents of evil directed
against her by her enemies. Lying awake and alone
in the house she had kept hearing ominous noises in
the garden and in the rooms below.</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>253</p>
<p>It was four o‚Äôclock when she awakened at last and
W&rsquo;ent down into the garden to attend to the business
of reburying the hateful statue. When she saw it
again, the halo of evil surrounding it struck her even
more forcibly. It was only after the reflection of
the wakeful night that she realized its full signifi-
cance. Why, she saw now that portions of the
statue had been stained, perhaps nineteen centuries
earlier, in an obscene fashion.</p>
<p>In bad Italian and with the aid of much panto-
mime, she finally conveyed to the workmen her idea.
When at last they understood her they exploded in
a wild burst of protest. She was unable to under-
stand any of it, though she understood well enough
that they were in a tremendous state of excitement.
They all screamed at her at once. In the very midst
of the uproar Pietro, the old goatherd, who lived
on the hillside below the villa, suddenly appeared
bearing two melons and a branch laden with green
olives. He was an immensely old man, dirty and
unkempt, with a scraggly grey beard and pointed ears
that stuck through apertures in the matted long grey
hair. He walked with a limp sidewise like a crab.
At sight of her he removed his battered hat and
gave her a series of grovelling bows.</p>
<p>At first she thought he had brought the melons
and olive branch as a gift for herself and touched
by the picturesqueness of Italian customs, she quickly
assumed the gracious manner of a chatelaine and
came forward to receive the offering. But Pietro
made it certain that they were not for her. As if
he thought that she meant to take them from him
by force, he cunningly shifted them behind his back</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>254</p>
<p>and made a flowery speech, of which she understood
not a word. Then his true purpose was revealed.
He went past her and laid them at the very feet of
the horrid statue. At the same moment, one of the
workmen, the bronze-chested Giovanni whose phy-
sique had caught the wandering eye of the Princess
d‚ÄôOrobelli, said something to him, and he in his turn
began to gibber at the now completely distracted
seeress. It appeared that the arrival of Pietro gave
them fresh courage. She saw that they intended to
prevent her by force from carrying out her plan of
doing away with the obscene thing. She was the
tenant of this property. She Intended to do with it
as she pleased. Her fleshy nostrils began to dis-
tend in an ominous way. Italians, so volatile by
nature, could not imagine the force of a grand-
daughter of Transcendentalists moved to anger by a
long series of torments. And unlike Miss Fosdick,
they had never witnessed the full fury of one of her
tantrums.</p>
<p>But at the crucial moment there appeared from
the opposite end of the garden a whole procession of
goats which had faithfully followed Pietro up the
stony hill. At the very end of the procession,
emerging from the tunnel of greenery, appeared Mr.
Winnery, nattily dressed for courting in a checked
suit, a new pearl grey hat and lemon yellow gloves.</p>
<p>Ill</p>
<p>Mr. Winnery, entering Into the cool dark garden,
was overcome, as he had been once before, by the cer-
tainty that he had lost his mind. He was aware</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>that as the last of a long procession of goats he had i</p>
<p>made an undignified entrance, but his resentment at ;</p>
<p>this died almost at once before the spectacle of the
Great Religious Experimenter surrounded by gib- ^</p>
<p>bering Italians who seemed bent upon doing her
some bodily violence. Fearful that Miss Fosdick
had perhaps already been done away with he hur- ;</p>
<p>ried forward through the midst of the flock of goats,
driving them out of his path with blows of his ma-
lacca stick ( just purchased on the strength of Aunt
Bessie‚Äôs legacy).</p>
<p>At sight of a male foreigner, even so harmless a
male foreigner as Mr. Winnery, the workmen grew
silent, and Pietro retired into concealment behind
them. Mrs. Weatherby, with a new face composed
almost Instantaneously, floated forward and greeted
him, explaining at the same time that she was having
difficulties with the woi&rsquo;kmen. There was perhaps
some confusion owing to their Inability to under-
stand each other. Perhaps Mr. Winnery would act
as interpreter.</p>
<p>He addressed the workmen and received in reply
a perfect torrent of explanation. They all spoke at
once and into their soft voices they threw whole
gamuts of seduction. It would perhaps never have
finished but in the midst of it he turned to Mrs.</p>
<p>Weatherby ‚Äî ‚ÄúThey are saying that you must not
bury the statue again. It Is an ancient god of fer-
tility and if you bury it they say the crops will be
blighted and the she-goats barren and the eggs un-
fertile. They say you will bring calamity on the
neighborhood. It is an ancient god of fertility.</p>
<p>Priapus, offspring of Dionysus and Aphrodite, or,</p>
<p>2s6 the strange case gf</p>
<p>if you prefer the Asiatic version, of Sabazius and
Astarte. They are quite right, though how they
know such a thing is beyond me. You will
find. . . .‚Äù</p>
<p>He would have, like the Italians, gone on for
some time explaining the legend of Priapus, but
Mrs. Weatherby interrupted. The nostrils had be-
gun again to distend and quiver. She seemed about
to snort fire.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is my garden,‚Äù she said quite firmly. ‚ÄúI shall
do with it as I like.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy not,‚Äù suggested Mr. Winnery tactfully,
‚Äúgive the thing to a museum?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo, I understand about these things. Plaven‚Äôt
I devoted my life to studies of the more psychic
religions? It is an evil omen and ought to be buried
again. I am certain of it. Ever since it was found
I have been having misfortunes.‚Äù</p>
<p>Winnery shrugged his shoulders. He failed to see
quite how the seeress could with intellectual honesty
support her own superstition and reject the much
more ancient one supported by Pietro and his party.
That, he supposed, was the common attitude of
superstitious and religious people. But he simply
turned to the workmen. He told them that the sig-
nora wanted the thing buried and that if they chose
not to obey her, she would find other workmen.
Deciding that they could risk a blight in the future
more easily than the loss of a job in the present,
they turned back sullenly, but not silently, and be-
gan to dig. Pietro made as if to launch a final pro-
test and then fell silent. The goats had by now
gathered in a circle about the scene of the conflict,</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>257</p>
<p>watching it with large round eyes. Mr. Winnery
had a fleeting impression that Pietro had winked
at him, but he could not be certain, and he could
not as a guest of Mrs. Weatherby endanger her
prestige by acknowledging the wink.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNow that we have settled it,‚Äù said Mrs. Weath-
erby more calmly, ‚Äúyou must have some tea.‚Äù</p>
<p>As they started toward the villa Mr. Winnery
‚ñ†turned again to regard the statue in disgrace. It
was a remarkably fine thing, he thought, and a pity
to bury it again. Still, with this eccentric woman,
arguments would arrive nowhere. She placed no
value upon anything in the world but her own ego.
It was a fine thing, the statue. At moments it
seemed almost to have a life of its own. Just now
in the heat of the afternoon it appeared lascivious
and amused as if it were saying, ‚ÄúYou may bury me
and unbury me a thousand times but you can‚Äôt be rid
of me. I shall be with you always.‚Äù</p>
<p>It was a pity, thought Mr. Winnery. It seemed
to him that the statue had brought him luck. Every-
thing had happened since Miss Annie Spragg had
died and the statue was dug up from the cess-
pool.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShoo !‚Äù cried Mrs. Weatherby, making threat-
ening gestures and pushing her way through the
goats. ‚ÄúShoo! Shoo!‚Äù</p>
<p>IV ‚ñ†</p>
<p>They had tea, the same bad tea out of rusty tins
that tasted as if it were made of hay, and dried di-
gestive biscuits very nearly as old, thought Mr.</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>258</p>
<p>Wlimery, as the freshly buried statue. Mrs. Weath-
erby at once struck an attitude in the fake Renais-
sance chair and began to talk about herself. Anubis
the parrot blinked at them and gave out a series of
disgruntled croaks. Everything was exactly the
same as before save that one of the Pomeranians,
Instead of yapping, lay with a pallid expression on
a Veronese green pillow trimmed with gold, and
that the view through the loggia was even more
magnificent in the clear transparent air that had
followed the dust-laden sirocco. He was aware that
there was still no sign of Miss Fosdick nor any
reference to her. He reminded himself that it was
Miss Fosdick after all whom he had come to see.
He did not care to hear any more of the history of
Mrs. Weatherby.</p>
<p>Once, however, Mrs. Weatherby did turn aside ‚ñ†
from her principal subject, but only long enough to
ask for tlhe latest developments in the scandalous
afiair of Miss Annie Spragg. He passed on to her
what he had heard that morning from Maria. It
was information which only left her where she had
been before. He had not, he told her when asked,
seen Father d‚ÄôAstier, although he had seen the
Principessa d‚ÄôOrobelll driving across the square
with a stranger, a man, to be exact. This bit of sim-
ple information he translated with the slight but
meaning inflection&rsquo; that had come to be a habit born
of long association with the old ladies of Brinoe.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA very interesting woman,‚Äù said Mrs. Weath-
erby. ‚ÄúI have never before seen an aura so red.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAh, you understand auras,‚Äù muiTnured Mr.
Winnery in a helpless effort to fill in time until he</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>259 '</p>
<p>gained the courage to ask where Miss Fosdick was *</p>
<p>hiding. He was not interested in auras except as ^</p>
<p>nonsense. (It was absurd that a man of his age</p>
<p>should be as shy as a schoolboy. Why could he not</p>
<p>utter Miss Fosdick‚Äôs name?) j</p>
<p>‚ÄúYes, it is a profound and interesting subject.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúHave you noticed my own?‚Äù asked Mr. Winnery
wildly. I</p>
<p>‚ÄúOh, yes, I noticed it at once yesterday by its
paleness. I had seldom seen so pale an aura. But
it has changed today remarkably. It is much
redder.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd what does that signify?‚Äù</p>
<p>Mrs. Weatherby simpered. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know that
I ought to tell you, Mr. Winnery. Still, you are an
intelligent man and will not misinterpret my interest
in such things.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúYes &hellip; no &hellip; of course not,‚Äù murmured
Mr. Winnery.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRed,‚Äù said Mrs. Weatherby, ‚Äúindicates pas-
sions of the body. I think ‚Äî she hesitated for a
moment and then plunged. ‚ÄúI think someone, some-
thing, some new ‚Äî shall I say ‚Äî interest? ‚Äî has en-
tered your life since yesterday.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúOh,‚Äù said Mr. Winnery, somewhat startled.</p>
<p>But he was aware again that he was flattered by the
change in his aura.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGreen is the color of the passions of the mind.</p>
<p>That of course is much worse . . . depraved, one
might say.‚Äù She was peering at him through her
glistening pince-nez with a mystical intensity that
made him squirm on the hard chair. He saw with
terror that she was scrutinizing his aura. ‚ÄúI am glad</p>
<p>26 o</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>to see, Mr. Winnery, that there is no trace of green
in your aura.‚Äù</p>
<p>Mr. Winnery murmured his gratitude and said
modestly he supposed that that was a thing you
could not control and that therefore he ought to
take no credit to himself. Secretly he was feeling
disturbed for fear that her intensity might increase
and throw her into a trance. What could he do
with her If she suddenly went into a trance ?</p>
<p>She did not. ‚ÄúThat is what interested me about
the statue,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúIt has an aura, Mr.
Winnery, a positive, unmistakable aura, and it Is
a vile mixture of red and green. That is why I
thought the thing better buried again at once.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd what does such a mixture signify?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat, Mr. Winnery, I cannot bring myself to
tell you. Will you have more tea ?‚Äù</p>
<p>But Mr. Winnery had done his duty to the social
amenities and did not feel called upon to drink a
second cup of hay-water.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt understand, Mrs. Weatherby, how a
statue, an inanimate thing, may have an aura. I
thought auras were connected, so to speak, with
what I suppose you would call the life fluid.‚Äù</p>
<p>He found himself wondering If Miss Fosdick had
been forced to undergo much of this sort of thing,
and his sympathy for her deepened and broadened.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt Is an extraordinary case. Doubtless the aura
Is an accumulation of evil thought directed toward
the statue during its worship some centuries ago.‚Äù</p>
<p>(Mr. Winnery thought, ‚ÄúI must ask after Miss
Fosdick and yet how dare I after she has discovered
the appearance of red in my aura.‚Äù) Aloud he</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>261</p>
<p>said, ‚ÄúI have never had the pleasure of knowing any-
one who saw auras. It must be very disconcert-
ing‚Äî I mean, always to see not only your friends but
their auras as well.‚Äù He was beginning to be
afraid of the woman.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is a privilege given to a few,‚Äù replied Mrs.
Weatherby with a certain smugness.</p>
<p>He then asked her about Miss Annie Spragg.
He felt, he said, that Mrs. Weatherby had been
somewhat constrained yesterday by the presence of
Father d‚ÄôAstier and the Principessa d‚ÄôOrobelli.
With him, of course, it was different. With him
she might feel quite free, as with a man of science.</p>
<p>But it was clear that her lips were to remain
sealed. She would say nothing. Yet there re-
mained with him the certainty that she knew far
more than she chose to tell. At last he rose and
made his adieux, filled suddenly with the terrible sus-
picion that the seeress believed he had come back to
the Villa Leonardo because he found her attractive.
A certain mincingness had entered her manner. She
bridled and held out her little finger as she raised the
teacup to her lips. Quite suddenly he was terrified
and filled with a sense of panic. What did this
extraordinary woman expect from him? For a mo-
ment he had the fantastic idea that the stone god
(which by now must be safely buried) was having its
revenge upon her.</p>
<p>She went with him to the door, snapping her
pince-nez back on the gold fleur-de-lis pin attached
to her ample bosom and thanking him for the call.
She urged him to come frequently. It was a lonely
place. They seldom saw many people but of course</p>
<p>262 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>it was impossible for her to live where the confusion
of twentieth century civilization broke in upon her
meditations. She would always arrange it so that
they could talk without intrusion.</p>
<p>As they reached the garden Winnery saw that the
work had been done. The statue was buried again
and atop the grave-like mound of reddish earth
Pietro had left the olive branch and the two melons
as a propitiatory offering. The goats had dis-
appeared.</p>
<p>Wildly he said, ‚ÄúI have not seen Miss Fosdick?
I was hoping to say good-day to her.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe is not here,‚Äù said Mrs. Weatherby.</p>
<p>There was a pause in which Mr. Winnery found
himself at a loss for conversation. At last he said,
‚ÄúI did not know she was going away?‚Äù (Why
should I know?)</p>
<p>‚ÄúYes. She has&rsquo; gone on a holiday, the first, I
must say, that she has had in twenty years. I
urged her to do it. I felt that she had had quite
enough of me. Dear Gertrude Is always so de-
voted. She never wants to leave me for a moment.‚Äù</p>
<p>This cast Mr. Winnery down. ‚ÄúShe must indeed
be devoted,‚Äù he murmured. And then suddenly ‚Äî
‚ÄúGood-by, Mrs. Weatherby, and thank you for the
tea.‚Äù</p>
<p>At the mouth of the tunnel he turned suddenly,
seized by what he felt must be the beginning of
madness. If Mrs. Weatherby happened to be look-
ing at his aura she must suddenly see that it had
turned flaming red. ‚ÄúWhen do you think she will
return?‚Äù he asked.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù said Mrs. Weatherby. ‚ÄúThat</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>263</p>
<p>was left open. I told her to stay away as long as
she liked. I don‚Äôt imagine she‚Äôll be away long.
She has been so devoted for twenty years. A thing
like that gets to be a habit. Have you ever noticed,
Mr. Winnery, that it is our habits and our friends
which give permanence and solidity to life?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúQuite right, Mrs. Weatherby, quite right.‚Äù</p>
<p>By breaking habits he had gotten himself Into
this muddle. Breaking habits by driving in the
hot afternoon with the African wind blowing.
Breaking habits by going to bed long after mid-
night. Breaking the habit of regarding people as
literary material rather than human creatures. He
had made this long trip for nothing. He had not
seen Miss Fosdick. He had not had a word with
her. He did not even know where she was and he
did not know when she would return. He had had
a wretched tea and ruined his clothes. The checked
suit, the new hat and yellow gloves reeked with the
strong smell of goat. But Mrs. Weatherby had
clearly been attracted by him. That he could not
forget.</p>
<p>v&rsquo; / .</p>
<p>Obstacles and difficulties, says an old senti-
mental proverb, only serve to increase a pas-
sion, and the disappearance of Miss Fosdick only
served to inflame Mr. Winnery. If Miss Fos-
dick had been at the Villa Leonardo she might have
said or done something which would have upset so
precise and finicky a man. There might have been
a hole In her stocking or she might have blown her
nose too loudly or, being surprised by the sudden</p>
<p>264 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>call of Mr. WInnery, her hair might have been done
sloppily. Since she was not there, none of these
things happened and Mr. Winnery left disappointed
(which is always good for love) and cherishing only
the memory of her richly curving bosom, her nice
eyes and her dove-like air. And since, despite him-
self, he really wanted to believe in the beauty and
virtue of Miss Fosdick and really wanted to have
his life disturbed and exciting now that his liver
troubled him less, he went on believing in these
things more and more passionately.</p>
<p>In the days that followed Mr. Winnery grew ani-
mated and slept very little, walking a great deal and
calling upon Mr. Winnop, the curate, and the few old
ladies who remained in Brinoe. He was even seized
with a fit of ambition to recover some of that glory
he had known a quarter of a century earlier as a
literary prodigy and set to work to bring order from
the confusion of notes, copyings and false starts
which represented the existing state of ‚ÄúMiracles
and Other Natural Phenomena.‚Äù He discovered
that love (for he conceded that love was the proper
diagnosis of his strange transformation) and the
creative instinct possessed an obscure and subtle
interrelation.</p>
<p>After much wrangling among the local clergy,
Miss Annie Spragg was buried at last in the little
cemetery on the far slope of Monte Salvatore. The
various parties reached a compromise and it was
decided at length that she was to be buried in conse-
crated ground but without the special attentions
which should have gone to a woman who was a
potential saint. Nevertheless a large number of the</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 265</p>
<p>poorer and more ignorant devout made up a dis-
orderly cortege which followed the coffin through
the dust all the way from Brinoe to Monte Salva-
tore. There were in it old men and women, a great
many dirty children who looked upon the excursion
in the light of an outing, three men who werel quite
drunk and sang, and even a woman pushing a per-
ambulator. Imm&rsquo;ediately behind the coffin marched
Sister Annunziata, who had disobeyed her superiors
and joined the cortege. She still had in her plain
face the light of a happiness that did not come of
this world. At her side walked Fulco Baldessare,
clad in his checkered bookmaker‚Äôs suit and protect-
ing himself from the brilliant sun with the black cot-
ton umbrella. It was all very gay and dishevelled, in
the best Italian tradition.</p>
<p>And when the excitement had died away a little
so that Mr. Winnery felt he might undertake his
investigation discreetly and without becoming in-
volved, he set out to visit Signora Bardelli. The
janitress, he felt, would be able to give him a
straightforward and realistic account of what had
happened, unmarred and distorted by the trimmings
with which more religious and emotional witnesses
were certain to decorate the strange case of Miss
Annie Spragg.</p>
<p>But Signora Bardelli had disappeared from the
Palazzo Gonfarini, and the new janitress, a gaunt,
witch-like and very dirty woman w&rsquo;ho had been
among those in the disorderly cortege, proved taci-
turn and ill-natured. It was only after Mr. Winnery
had pressed into her hand a fraction of Aunt Bessie‚Äôs</p>
<p>266</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>fortune that she told him what had happened and
where the former janitress could be found.</p>
<p>Signora Bardelli, it appeared, had behaved scan-
dalously. No sooner had the body of Miss Annie
Spragg been removed from the Palazzo Gonfarini
than the janitress began spreading a singular story.
She expressed it as her belief that Miss Annie
Spragg was not a holy woman at all but that she had
been in alliance with the dark powers of fertility
during her entire lifetime. Her relics, said Signora
Bardelli, were efficacious in the case of barren
women. Although she conceded a belief that any
of the relics possessed a certain power, she was con-
vinced that its very center was concentrated in the
only piece of furniture left behind by the relic-
snatchers ‚Äî ^the bed upon which Miss Annie Spragg
had died. The act of spending a night in this bed
had, she declared, a miraculous effect. She fixed a
price of forty lira for the privilege and before
Father d‚ÄôAstier, her employer, discovered the out-
rage she had already accumulated three customers.
And then Father d‚ÄôAstier had come to the palace in
person and had thrown her into the street. But she
had taken the miraculous bed with her and she was
now living in a tiny house in the village of Monte
Salvatore, where she had set It up once more and
was doing a good business.</p>
<p>Fate, reflected Mr. Winnery, was always drawing
him back to Monte Salvatore.</p>
<p>But before going he went to seek out the fat little
Father Baldessare and the gaunt Sister Annunziata
to gather from them their version of the miracle.
The priest had disappeared completely, none knew</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 267</p>
<p>whither. His former acquaintances only confirmed
the gossip of Maria‚Äî that he had gone out to bring
the world back to the simplicity of Jesus. He had,
they believed, now gone completely mad, but since
in Italy people paid small attention to crazy people
there was nothing to be done about it. At the con-
vent Sister Maria Maddelena told him that Sister
Annunziata could see no one. She had been ill for
a week and quite out of her head. In her illness
she had gone about saying such astounding and scan-
dalous things that they thought it better to keep her
in seclusion until the poor thing had recovered her
senses.</p>
<p>Mr. Winnery, somewhat cast down, hired a fiacre
and set out for Monte Salvatore. He felt that in
all the confusion of the superstition and madness it
would be refreshing to talk with a woman of hard,
common sense like Signora Bardelli.</p>
<p>As Mr. Winnery made his entrance Signora Bar-
delli was just receiving forty lira from a pretty
young peasant woman who had spent the night on
the bed of Miss Annie Spragg. The woman was
telling her story for the third time. She had been
married seven years and although she had prayed
to all the saints of fertility there had been no
answer to her prayer. Her husband was growing
impatient. He already had a child outside of wed-
lock and he was fonder of this child than of his wife.
The woman wept a little and Signora Bardelli
assured her with all the authority and brightness of</p>
<p>268</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>a successful surgeon that from now on everything
would be all right.</p>
<p>It was a small room in one of the bilious yellow
houses of Monte Salvatore and it stood on the slope
of the hill overlooking the lonely valley where the
Villa Leonardo perched in its decaying and lonely
splendor. In the evening the very shadow of the
monastery fell across its doorstep. Unwilling to
intrude upon the delicate transactions that were tak-
ing place, Mr. Winnery waited just outside the door.</p>
<p>He heard the former janitress giving the young
woman earnest advice. Then he heard her selling
for ten lira a mixture composed, she said, of amber,
laurel and a powder made from the hill viper. This
the young woman was to put into her husband‚Äôs
wine every night for seven nights following the next
change of the moon. And she sold a charm contain-
ing a phial of powder (composition undescribed dur-
ing the transaction) which she was to wear sus-
pended between her two breasts. If nothing hap-
pened within three months Signora Bardelli advised
returning to spend another night in the bed of Sig-
norlna Spragg. Some cases, she pointed out, were
more difficult than others. It all sounded, thought
Mr. Winnery, rather like the last consultation he
had had with the expensive Doctor Gosse on the
subject of his liver.</p>
<p>Then the peasant woman departed and Mr. Win-
nery brightly made his entrance. He planned to
take Signora Bardelli directly into his confidence
and so let her understand that he knew she w&rsquo;as a
shrewd and clever swindler.</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 269</p>
<p>His plan failed. The former janitress eyed him
at once with suspicion, and even after he had ex-
plained his mission and the great work he had under-
taken in driving superstition from the world, she
warmed only a little. And that faint shade of
warmth he- divined only when he referred to the
superstitions of the Church. She was, however,
willing to discuss the case of Miss Annie Spragg and
asked him to sit down, giving him to understand that
the talk would be in the nature of a consultation and
would, of course, call for a fee.</p>
<p>Mr. Winnery, dashed a bit by his reception,
thought bitterly, ‚ÄúThese free, generous Italians.‚Äù</p>
<p>It was a square plain room in which dried herbs
hung from the ceiling together with strings of garlic
and red peppers. The walls, once painted white,
were blackened by smoke. At one side there was a
row of shelves with pots and jars of many sizes,
colors, and descriptions, neatly arranged according
to size, and in one comer there was a sort of throne
like that in a restaurant. It had a till for receiving
money. The whole room was all arranged effi-
ciently, rather in the manner, thought Mr. Winnery,
of the office of a specialist who charged five guineas
a consultation. Certainly it was an organized busi-
ness, quite as organized as the Church itself. The
room was quite clean.</p>
<p>270 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>lonely valley and far off, dimly seen through the
haze of heat, he discerned the dark grove of trees
which marked the Villa Leonardo.</p>
<p>THE JANITRESS‚Äô TALE</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>S HE did not know how Miss Annie Spragg had
come to take lodgings in the Palazzo Gonfarini.
The old maid was already installed when Signora
Bardelli took over the post of janitress on the death
of the old man who had preceded her as caretaker.
Miss Annie Spragg was already established and a
fixture she remained. She was not a troublesome
tenant. She did not, like some of Signora Bardelli‚Äôs
lodgers, return home drunk or beat her children or
stab indiscriminately the other lodgers. She seemed
to have no wants and in all the years she lived there
she had never made a complaint. She was very
clean and seemed content with a room which con-
tained only a bed, a chair and a w&rsquo;ashstand. She
always paid her rent regularly until three weeks
before her death, and then, of course, she could not
pay it because her money had come to an end.
Where this money had come from Signora Bardelli
did not know. Miss Annie Spragg had never in all
the years she had lived in the Palazzo Gonfarini
received a letter. She had no friends and much
of her time was spent in the churches, mainly at San
Giovanni before the celebrated paintings of Saint
John the Shepherd, She had learned to speak a</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>271</p>
<p>little Italian but she was never really able to con-
verse in that tongue.</p>
<p>In the third year after the jani tress came to the
Palazzo Gonfarini, Miss Annie Spragg came one
day and asked her if she knew where there was a
place she could go in the mountains to pass a month
now and then. It must be very cheap, she said, be-
cause she had no money, and she would like it to be
in some rather remote region where she would not
be troubled by tourists. Signora Bardelli thought
at once of her sister-in-law who lived in a village
called Bestia, high in a remote part of the moun-
tains. She sent word by a cousin (since neither the
sister-in-law nor her husband could read) and re-
ceived an answer that they would be glad of the
money to be got by having the visitor. It was
arranged to meet Miss Annie Spragg at Analo,
which was the terminal of the railroad. Beyond
Analo there were only mountain roads and donkey
carts.</p>
<p>It was a wild country, said the janitress, which she
had not seen since childhood.&rsquo; There were a few
olive orchards and herds of goats and halfway down
the mountains they were able to grow vines in the
crevices of the volcanic rock. There were wolves
which in winter became ferocious and sometimes
attacked people in remote villages and farms. At
Bestia there was no church and the inhabitants
were forced to drive all the way to Analo to com-
municate with a priest. Therefore, they seldom
saw priests except when someone died or was born.
Sometimes children grew to manhood and woman-
hood and died without ever being received into the</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>272</p>
<p>church. They had a kind of religion of their own
which was a mixture of Christianity and old legends,
half lost in the mists of time. It was at Bestia that
Signora Bardelli had learned the science of herbs
and charms. The people there knew about such
things and one old woman, long since dead, had
taught all she knew to the janitress.</p>
<p>(She had long sold herbs and charms to the poor,
the janitress said, but it was only since she had ac-
quired the bed of Miss Annie Spragg and lost her
place as janitress that she had really set herself up
in a legitimate way.)</p>
<p>The family of the sister-in-law consisted of the
mother and father (a goatherd) and eleven chil-
dren. There was a room over the stable which
they gave to Miss Annie Spragg when she arrived
bearing a straw suitcase and an empty bird cage.
The entire family slept in one room.</p>
<p>From the beginning their strange lodger proved
a help to them. She asked nothing and she paid
regularly. She did not talk much and spent a great
deal of time on the mountain, setting out in the
morning with bread and cheese and a little wine, and
returning at sunset. On her second visit she offered
timidly to watch Giusseppi‚Äôs goats while they wan-
dered along the mountainside. These were willful
and troublesome goats which wandered off into
ravines and woods and caused Giusseppi much
anxiety, but with Miss Annie Spragg their character
appeared to undergo a change. They became docile
and stayed near her while she was making water-
color sketches or knitting-, clothes for Giusseppi‚Äôs
half-clad family or simply wandering about over the</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>273</p>
<p>mountamside gathering wild flowers and listening to
the birds. She was a great help to Giusseppi be-
cause her taking charge of the goats freed another
son to help him in the rude orchards and vineyards.
People began to notice that she had a strange power
over animals and to regard her with respect. It was
only the wife (Signora Bardelll‚Äôs sister-in-law) who
did not like her. She thought there was something
strange about the lodger and even spread the story
that Miss Annie Spragg had the power of the evil
eye.</p>
<p>Among the children of the sister-in-law there was
one, a little girl of nine, who, her parents believed,
was possessed of a devil. The old priest from
Analo had tried to exorcise the demon and when he
had failed they sought the aid of the old woman who
was the herb doctor. She also tried and failed.
The child‚Äôs name was Peppina and she gave them a
great deal of trouble. She was a pretty child with
thick black hair and great black eyes and for days
at a time she would be well behaved and docile. But
she had seizures when she would run away and hide
among the ravines of the mountainside. Some-
times they would not find her for days. Once she
fell into a stream and was nearly drowned and on
another time she set fire to the house in which they
lived. She fell down at times in a fit and had
strange visions.</p>
<p>Upon this child Miss Annie Spragg had the same
effect as upon the goats. With the old maid Pep-
pina remained docile and well behaved, but as soon
as Miss Annie Spragg left Bestia the child began
once more to cause them trouble and they had to</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>274</p>
<p>beat her and try new ways of driving out the demon.
When she was eleven she took to accompanying the
old maid and the goats when they set out in the
morning to feed on the mountainside.</p>
<p>For five years Miss Annie Spragg went each sum-
mer to occupy the room over the stable at Bestia
and each time when she returned to the Palazzo
Gonfarini she brought with her a cage filled with
small birds, most of them being a kind of sparrow
which frequented the mountains and because of its
smallness was worth nothing as food to the peasants.
When she left her room in the Palazzo Gonfarini
in the spring Miss Annie Spragg opened the window
and allowed them to escape. Signora Bardelli be-
lieved they were always the same birds. They spent
the winter at the Palazzo Gonfarini and flew back in
summer to rejoin Miss Annie Spragg at Bestia.
Once she even brought back with her a box filled
with field mice.</p>
<p>In Bestia they no longer thought her queer. She
became a part of the place. They even came to
date things by the arrival and the departure of the
old maid, as if her coming marked the beginning of
summer and her departure the arrival of the long
Italian autumn.</p>
<p>She might have continued going summer after
summer to Bestia, said Signora Bardelli, but a
strange thing happened. One night at midnight her
brother-in-law was awakened by the smell of smoke
and discovered that the house was burning. At first
he believed that it was the demon in Peppina who
had set the fire a second time, but when he had
awakened all his family he discovered that Peppina</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>275</p>
<p>was not there at all. He discovered too that the
lodger‚Äôs room above the stable was empty and that
in the stable the goats had disappeared. When he
had put out the fire he set out to find the goats.</p>
<p>In the darkness he went up the mountainside call-
ing out Peppina‚Äôs name and uttering at intervals the
half-human, half-animal cry which he used in calling
the goats when they had strayed. But there was no
answer. He had wandered for hours over the rocks
and pastures when dawn at last began to slip in
through the valleys and crevasses and down the wild
rocky slopes, and he turned toward home. Cold
blue mist veiled the hillside and clung to the groves
of ancient olive trees planted among the outcrop-
pings of grey tufa. The poor man, not knowing
what to think, began to believe that Peppina‚Äôs demon
had swept Peppina and their lodger and his goats
off into limbo. As his bewilderment increased he
became certain that he would never see any of them
again. He regretted the loss of Peppina, said the
ex-janitress, far less than he regretted the loss of
the goats, for she was only a source of trouble to her
parents and goats were valuable property. He be-
gan to fret over what he would tell the police when
it was discovered that Miss Annie Spragg too had
been swallowed up. He told himself that this was
what came of having to do with a strange foreign
woman, and that his wife was right in suspecting her
of being a witch.</p>
<p>In the midst of his reflections he heard suddenly
the faint far-off tinkle of the bell that the black he-
goat wore about his neck, and halting, he stood lis-
tening until he made certain that he was not</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>276</p>
<p>imagining the sound, and then to discover from what
direction the sound came. Looking down he saw
far below him, half hidden in mists so that it was
visible one moment and not the next, a little proces-
sion which had a strange likeness to a procession of
children on their way from a first communion. At
the head walked sedately the black he-goat who
wore the bell, and behind him came all the herd.
In the rear, like the parents who followed the chil-
dren, walked Miss Annie Spragg and Peppina.
They seemed to be wearing wreaths on their heads
and Miss Annie Spragg was without the black veil
she always wore.</p>
<p>There was no way of descending directly to them
and the puzzled man was forced to go by the tor-
tuous narrow paths that led down among the rocks
and trees. When he reached the bottom of the
crevasse the procession had disappeared, but there
remained in the red earth the neat little prints of
goat‚Äôs hoofs.</p>
<p>When he reached the farm once more it was quite
light but he found that all his family were still
asleep, and that beside the oven on her mattress of
straw Peppina was also sleeping soundly. In the
stable the goats were in their pen as they should
have been and when he entered they pushed forward
behind their leader, the black he-goat, to be led
out to feed. And in the room overhead Miss Annie
Spragg was asleep. On the floor beside her there
were .a few bruised and withe/ed laurel leaves.</p>
<p>Thinking that he too must be possessed of a
demon who had driven him out on the mountain in
the middle of the night for nothing, the poor man</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>277</p>
<p>returned and roused his wife, telling her all that he
had seen. Because he was confused and could not
believe his senses they examined the beams above the
oven to make certain there had ever been a fire.
There had been a fire. The beams were all charred.
They went to awaken Peppina but she could not be
awakened. They struck her and called her evil
names but the girl only slept on quietly. The
smaller children wakened and began to scream with
fright, and in all the confusion the father lost his
head and sat down and wept. But his wife did not
take leave of her senses. She cried out that their
lodger was a witch and that she had known it all
along and now they would be free of her at last.
She went to the stable and roused Miss Annie
Spragg, who said nothing in reply to the woman‚Äôs
abuse but packed her shabby bag in silence. Then
the old maid set out along the road to Analo carry-
ing her bag, her cage of little birds and her box of
water colors. The wife followed her for three
miles along the road, hiding from time to time in
the bushes and behind rocks to watch and make cer-
tain that she did not return and to see whether she
might not vanish abruptly into thin air.</p>
<p>When the figure of the old maid had disappeared
at last on the serpentine road leading down the
mountain to the high valley of Analo, the woman
returned to the lonely farm and taking beeswax and
three red hairs and seven nail parings from a little
box, she moulded the beeswax into the image of the
thin old maid and embedded the nail parings and
the three hairs deep in the wax, and sticking a pin
through the place where the heart should have been.</p>
<p>278 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>she threw the whole thing into the oven. She had
been waiting all the while. The red hair was Miss
Annie Spragg‚Äôs hair and the parings were the
parings of Miss Annie Spragg‚Äôs nails.</p>
<p>When the image had gone up in a burst of flame,
Peppina stirred on her bed and wakened, but when
they talked to her she could remember nothing.
She had, she said, been asleep in her bed all the
night.</p>
<p>She was fifteen years old at the time, and de-
veloped like a woman of thirty.</p>
<p>But it was the end of Peppina, said Signora Bar-
delli. After that the demon claimed her for his
own. She had many respectable suitors, some of
whom were rich, but she would have none of them
and ran off in the end with a corporal of the Cara-
binieri, who had been sent into the mountains to run
to earth a notorious brigand. He was a gigantic
and ugly brute, more like an animal than a man.
He beat her cruelly and was stabbed to death at last
by a man he found in Peppina‚Äôs bed when he came
home unexpectedly. After that Peppina disap-
peared. A young native of Analo returning from
South America said he had seen her there in a
brothel on the water front of Rio de Janeiro. She
was dancing naked in the midst of a circle of sailors,
white men and black men, yellow men and brown
men. But no one Icnew for certain that the woman
was Peppina.</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>279</p>
<p>THE ROMANCE OF MR. WINNERY</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>M r. WINNERY, listening to the tale, grew
more and more bewildered. This woman</p>
<p>whom he had expected to find sensible he saw was
no different from all the others. He saw that she
believed all that she was telling him and that he
could never persuade her that it was all nonsense.
She too was like all the others, the prey of supersti-
tion, the victim of ancient legends. It was simply
another kind of superstition, different and more an-
cient and more deeply rooted than the superstitions
which led Sister Annunziata to believe that she was
chosen by Saint Francis as the elect of God. Sister
Annunziata was more than half crazy, and they
were right perhaps in shutting her up, but this
shrewd hard peasant woman was clearly not mad.
To Sister Annunziata Miss Annie Spragg was a
white saint and to Signora Bardelli the old maid
was a black saint.</p>
<p>He said to her, ‚ÄúBut the Stigmata? How can a
witch have received the miracle of the Stigmata?‚Äù</p>
<p>She looked at him mysteriously and replied,
‚ÄúThat I do not know.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is all very strange.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI do not know,‚Äù observed Signora Bardelli, ‚Äúun-
less it is the work of the Devil. Perhaps it is a joke
played on the Church by something that is older
than the Church, older even than Christianity. I</p>
<p>280 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>have been told that things like that are the oldest
things in the world.‚Äù</p>
<p>She was stubborn and would not be shaken from
her beliefs into the admission that her sister-in-law
and her husband might have imagined such a story,
or that there had really been none of the marks of
the Stigmata on the body of Miss Annie Spragg.
She had seen the scars with her own eyes.</p>
<p>A figure suddenly filled the doorway, throwing a
blue shadow across the earthen floor. It was a tall,
heavy woman, a peasant with a light shawl thrown
over her head to keep off the sun. She spoke to
Signora Bardelli. She had walked down from the
mountains twenty-seven miles to sleep in the bed of
Miss Annie Spragg. She had been married for
thirteen years and had never had a child. .</p>
<p>Mr. Winnery, with a sense of intruding a second
time upon a delicate situation, rose and gave Sig-
nora Bardelli ten lira for the consultation. Then he
bade her good-by, aware that she had disapproved
of him as one who sought to meddle in things he
could not understand. The tall heavy peasant
woman sat wearily down on the chair he had left,
and he walked out again into the blazing square
where the battered fiacre and the bony horses stood
waiting for him in the shadow of an enormous fig
tree. For a moment the light blinded him. He felt
weary and hot. And then he saw the deep cool
valley of Monte Salvatore coming into form and on
its side the distant black patch of cypresses that
marked the Villa Leonardo.</p>
<p>A sense of the immense futility of everything
swept over him and he thought, ‚ÄúWhy should I</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>281</p>
<p>trouble myself about these things? Let them believe
what they like. That peasant woman is happier in
the hope that a night on the Spragg woman‚Äôs bed
will give her the power of bringing more brats into
an over-crowded world. She is happier than if she
had stayed in her village without any hope. Life
is short and I have wasted most of it. It is time
that I began to bring my life to something.‚Äù</p>
<p>Suddenly he wasn‚Äôt interested in miracles and
other natural phenomena. He wanted to see Miss
Fosdick. The heat, the smell of the fig tree, the
sight of the former janitress doing her best to make
the world a fertile place made him feel languorous.
He became the prey of his own imagination. He, a
respectable man of fifty-three who had led a virginal
existence, was becoming amorous.</p>
<p>He wakened the sleeping driver and said, ‚ÄúGo to
the Villa Leonardo.‚Äù And pointing with the ma-
lacca stick he had purchased to celebrate the passing
of Aunt Bessie and the beginning of his courtship
he added, ‚ÄúIt is yonder. That patch of C5rpresses.‚Äù</p>
<p>He would face Mrs. Weatherby again and tell
her the truth ‚Äî that he proposed to marry her com-
panion, and that nothing could stop him, not even
the famous twenty years of devotion.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>As he drove up the long avenue between the rows
of grotesque and ancient oaks he was stirred again
by the villa‚Äôs sense of loneliness and utter isolation.
The windows were again tightly shuttered and this
time there was no red and black motor standing be-</p>
<p>282</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>fore the door. The white flame of yucca set among
swords had turned brown and dead and withered
away. He got down ‚Äî it had become a habit with
him, as if he were an old friend of the household ‚Äî
and went through the dark tunnel of greenery. The
garden had an unkempt look, for the dry heat of
early autumn had detached the yellow leaves of the
plane trees and left them dead and drifted In little
piles along the colonnades of mottled trunks. The
grave where the statue had been reburied had sunk
now so that there was a little hollow instead of a
mound. Then he discovered that the back of the
villa presented the same appearance as the front. It
was closed. Every door and shutter was fastened.
They had gone away (he saw) and Miss Fosdick
was perhaps lost forever.</p>
<p>With the malacca stick he pounded on the door.
A kind of recklessness entered his soul. He called
out the name of Miss Fosdick but no one answered.
He was about to leave when he saw emerging from
the decaying stables the abundant figure of Margha-
rlta. The girl came toward him and when she was
near enough to speak she said that Signora Wetter-
bee had gone away, not only for this season but
forever. She did not know where she had gone but
she supposed she had gone back to her house in
Brinoe. When he asked her why she had gone
away the girl said that she had taken a dislike to the
place. The villa itself had been sold over Signora
Wetterbee‚Äôs head. The truth, she added, was that
she had been driven out.</p>
<p>It was all the doing of the statue, she said. It
ought never to have been burled again. It was tak-</p>
<p>283</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>ing vengeance on Signora Wetterbee. No sooner
was it buried than strange things began to happen.
Signora Wetterbee had been unable to sleep and in
the middle of the night she had heard music and
sounds of wild gayeties in the garden. She, Mar-
gharita, had heard none of the sounds nor any of the
other servants, but Signora Wetterbee insisted there
were sounds and accused them of disturbing her rest,
although, said Margharita, they had all been sleep-
ing soundly. It went on night after night and then
one morning Signora Wetterbee packed all her be-
longings and got into the Ford with her dogs and
the parrot Anubis without even saying good-by, and
Giovanni drove her back to Brinoe. Signora Wet-
terbee, she said, was a strange woman and imagined
things. It was her belief that perhaps Signora
Wetterbee was a witch. She had seen her standing
on her head on the terrace in the moonlight clad only
in a pair of man‚Äôs trousers. Surely such goings-on
could be indulged in only by a witch. What did the
Signor think?</p>
<p>Mr. Winnery, who by now had begun to think
that he was losing his reason, said that perhaps
she was a witch or perhaps she was only doing the
exercises that were part of a certain religious cult.
Who, he asked, had bought the villa ?</p>
<p>It was the Principessa d‚ÄôOrobelli. Margharita
had heard that she had bought it suddenly without
even asking the price and that she meant to retire to
it and spend the rest of her life there. She had not
even come to see the place. She had heard that the
Principessa planned to install bathrooms. That,
thought Margharita, would be exciting. She had</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>284</p>
<p>never seen a bathroom. Was it true that the Prin-
cipessa was an American lady?</p>
<p>And then quite suddenly Margharita said, ‚ÄúSig-
nora Wetterbee went away three days ago but Sig-
norina Fosdeek returned this morning.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù cried Mr. Winnery. ‚ÄúWhere is she?‚Äù</p>
<p>Margharita said she did not know it was Sig-
norina Fosdeek he wanted to see. She thought it
was Signora Wetterbee. She even (and here she
became arch) thought that perhaps there was a ro-
mance with Signora Wetterbee. Signorina Fosdeek
had arrived on foot carrying her bag.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn foot?‚Äù exclaimed Mr. Winnery. ‚ÄúIn this
heat?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúSi, si. And she ran away on foot.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúRan away?‚Äù repeated Mr. Winnery.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe ran away. Signora Wetterbee did not
know she was going.‚Äù</p>
<p>A great light burst on Mr. Winnery. He wasted
no more time talking with Margharita. Leaving
her astonished in the midst of a long recital, he went
to the villa and this time without knocking he pushed
open the door. There was a rustle of dried leaves
in the hallway and a rat scurried off into the
shadows. He did not like rats. The sight of
them made his hair rise up on end. But he pushed
bravely on, calling out, ‚ÄúMiss Fosdick ! Miss Fos-
dickl‚Äù again and again. But there was no answer.
The name simply echoed through the empty house.
Perhaps, he thought wildly, she has killed herself
and I shall find the body. He went from room to
room. All were closed and the only light filtered in
dimly from the cracks in the shutters. The big</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>285</p>
<p>salon overlooking the valley was empty and the
bare dining room and the small room under the
stairway. He started up the stairs and was half
way to the top when he heard below him a slight
scuffling sound, among the dead leaves. Turning
he saw Miss Fosdick. She had come out of the
salon and was trying to escape before he discovered
her.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMiss Fosdick,‚Äù he called out. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been
searching for you.‚Äù</p>
<p>She halted and stood against the wall without
looking at him. She had in her hand the worn
handbag. The black dress was covered with dust to
the knees and her hat had slipped a little over one
ear. She was flushed and trembling and her brown
hair was all in disarray.</p>
<p>He came down the stairs toward her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve
been looking for you,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been twice
before to call at the villa. Mrs. Weatherby told me
you had gone off on a holiday.‚Äù He tried to put
her at her ease by behaving as if there was nothing
in the least strange in finding her thus. ‚ÄúI really
wanted to see you again.‚Äù</p>
<p>She began suddenly to cry. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to see
you. I don‚Äôt want to see anyone. I only want to
die. I‚Äôm useless and no good to anyone. I‚Äôm bet-
ter out of the way. I ought to kill myself but I
can‚Äôt even do that properly.‚Äù</p>
<p>He had arrived in time. She had been thinking
of suicide.</p>
<p>Without quite knowing what he was doing he
slipped an arm gently about her sho^j^erSp^rSb^did
not protest or draw away fronviJ^s^TT?^</p>
<p>J</p>
<p>286</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not useless, Miss Fosdick,‚Äù he said
gently. ‚ÄúNone of God‚Äôs creatures are useless.
Come, let‚Äôs sit down somewhere and talk. I‚Äôve
been looking for you for days.‚Äù</p>
<p>She seemed too tired either to protest or speak
and he led her gently into the big salon. He did
not think of his own feelings, for in the excitement he
had forgotten to be literary. Miss Fosdick seemed
plumper and prettier than he bad ever imagined,
and in her distress far more charming.</p>
<p>The furniture had been stacked into one corner.
He selected one of the uncomfortable chairs and
bade her sit in it. She obeyed him meekly as a
rabbit. Then he opened the shutters and in a blaze
of golden light the whole length of the glorious val-
ley opened up before them. Drawing up another un-
comfortable chair he seated himself and said, ‚ÄúTell
me now. Perhaps I can help you.‚Äù But she
seemed unable to do anything but sob. ‚ÄúMargha-
rita,‚Äù he said, ‚Äútold me you had run away. She
told me the whole story.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then the flood gates burst and the whole torrent
poured forth. She told him the long story of her
twenty years‚Äô devotion to Mrs. Weatherby and how
in the end when she could stand it no longer she had
run away. And she had come back because her
money had given out and at the pension they would
keep her no longer unless she paid in advance. She
had tried to get work as a companion. She had
even advertised in the papers but there had only
been three replies. One was from a clergyman‚Äôs
widow who required that she know how to crochet
and do tatting. Another was from an elderly</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>‚Ä¢V&rsquo;
287</p>
<p>spinster who wanted to be read to in Italian, and the
third was from a retired army officer with an in-
valid wife who required a woman who was young
and pretty and who had been trained as a nurse.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd I,‚Äù said Miss Fosdick, ‚Äúcan do none of
these things. So I came back. &hellip; I came back to
Aunt Henrietta and now she has gone. I don‚Äôt
know what I‚Äôm to do. I haven‚Äôt any more money
and I don‚Äôt know how to do anything but be a com-
panion to Aunt Henrietta. I ought to die.‚Äù</p>
<p>Mr. Winnery, feeling very masculine and mediae-
val, told her that they must first of all be practical.</p>
<p>She must go back to Brinoe in the fiacre with him.</p>
<p>He would lend her money until they worked out her
problem. He told her about Aunt Bessie‚Äôs death
and how he was now a rich man. He had a feeling
for her, he said, from the very beginning. He had
known all along that she was unhappy with the
seeress.</p>
<p>But Miss Fosdick suddenly grew respectable and
unfeminine. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt do that.</p>
<p>I couldn‚Äôt accept any money from a gentleman I
barely know. A lady can‚Äôt do such things.‚Äù</p>
<p>For a moment Mr. Winnery was irritated, and
then he remembered that of course she was in trouble
and he must be gentle with her. He tried to make
her understand that it was purely a business matter
and that she could pay him back. But beneath his
arguments Miss Fosdick only grew more and more
respectable. He might have been a lecherous old
man planning the ruin of a young virgin. He wanted
to say, ‚ÄúWell, if you don‚Äôt borrow money from&rsquo; me
what on earth are you going to do?‚Äù He would have</p>
<p>288</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>said it if he had not thought her so charming with
her plump face flushed and her eyes damp with tears.
And then he thought of a solution.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou can pay me back by going to work for me.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut how can I work for you? There is nothing
I can do.‚Äù</p>
<p>Nevertheless at this shadow of hope she grew
more quiet and took a handkerchief from her hand-
bag and began to dry her eyes.</p>
<p>Mr. Winnery explained to her all about Miracles
and other Natural Phenomena and the state of
confusion in which the vast amount of notes, copy-
ings and references continually found themselves.
It would be her task to keep them in order, tied into
little bundles and ticketed. It was not a difficult
task, he pointed out, nor one that required training.
All it needed was a clear head.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut I haven‚Äôt a clear head,‚Äù echoed Miss Fos-
dick. ‚ÄúI always muddle everything.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWell, well. In any case we must make a try.
It will be a help to me and will provide money for
you.‚Äù</p>
<p>While he was speaking Mr. Winnery made a re-
markable discovery. It was this ‚Äî that during the
period Miss Fosdick had apparently been drying her
tears her flushed face had grown perceptibly paler.
For a moment he thought with alarm that perhaps
she meant to faint. And then suddenly he under-
stood the phenomenon. Undoubtedly there was a
powder puff concealed In the folds of the handker-
chief. The discovery touched him. As a means
of powdering the nose it was a fashion so much
more refined than that used by women like, well,</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>289</p>
<p>like the d‚ÄôOrobelli, who simply extracted an appa-
ratus from her bag and sent boldly the powder fly-
ing in all directions.</p>
<p>Again he touched Miss Fosdick‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúThere
now,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre feeling better, aren‚Äôt you?
There‚Äôs no need of ever going back to Mrs. Weath-
erby. Never again.‚Äù</p>
<p>Miss Fosdick admitted almost grudgingly that
there did seem to be hope.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd now we can start back to Brinoe. I have a
fiacre outside. I will pay you a week‚Äôs wages in
advance and you can go back to the pension.‚Äù</p>
<p>Miss Fosdick thought perhaps she had better take
less than that. She doubted whether she would last
a week. But Mr. Winnery reassured her. ‚ÄúMrs.
Weatherby,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúalways preaches self-confi-
dence is the first of the virtues. Besides, I am
certain that you are just the secretary I‚Äôve been
seeking. I‚Äôm sure,‚Äù he added with meaning, ‚Äúthat
you‚Äôll last for months and for years.‚Äù</p>
<p>They went through the empty hall where the
dead leaves still rustled in the draught from the
open door, and on the steps leading down into the
garden Mr. Winnery halted a moment to regard the
view.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is a beautiful place,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt would be
a splendid place to live, only I hear the Princess
d‚ÄôOrobelli has bought it for herself.‚Äù</p>
<p>in</p>
<p>They drove back to Brinoe, where Mr. Winnery
escorted her to her pension, and the next morning at</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>290</p>
<p>ten she appeared for work. She lasted one week,
and then two and then three, tasting for the first
time the sweets of a woman‚Äôs economic indepen-
dence. She muddled the mass of notes and papers
hopelessly so that Mr. Winnery was unable to find
anything he wanted, whereas before he had been
able to find at least a few things. But it did not
seem to annoy Mr. Winnery and at the beginning
of the fourth week he asked Miss Fosdick quite
suddenly to marry him and quite suddenly she
accepted.</p>
<p>It was agreed that they were to go to Iowa on
their honeymoon because Mr. W^innery had a de-
sire to see America and Mrs. Winnery wanted to
revisit Winnebago Falls. Not the least of her
motives was a desire to exhibit her rich and dis-
tinguished husband. As a kind of second thought
Mr. Winnery said that it would give him an oppor-
tunity to go into the very beginnings of the strange
case of Miss Annie Spragg.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>A week before Mr. Winnery paid Signora Bar-
delli the only visit he ever made her, the Principessa
gave in Venice the famous fete which each year
marked the peak of the season. It attained a new
measure of splendor and magnificence and attracted
the fashionable and the notorious from every part
of Europe. Millionaires, decayed royaltry, gigoloes,
actresses, demi-mondaines ; even two ministers of
state enjoying pompous holidays were present. It
went off in a blaze of triumph with Bengal lights and</p>
<p>291</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>three orchestras and a whole fleet of decorated gon-
dolas. Anna d‚ÄôOrobelli and Oreste, Duke of Fon-
terrabia, appeared in the costumes of the Countess
Guiccioli and Lord Byron, and Father d‚ÄôAstier was
seen moving about wearily and looking old and tired
in the robes of Mazarin, which suited him to perfec-
tion. It was the first ball in years which Mr. Win-
nery had not described at second hand in his cor-
respondence to the Ladies‚Äô Own World.</p>
<p>And two days later when the curtains of Anna
d‚ÄôOrobeUi‚Äôs bedchamber were pulled back to let the
morning sun stream in, there was a letter on the
lacquered tray beside her chocolate. It was the let-
ter in the handwriting of the Duque de Fonterrabia
which she had been awaiting for nearly two years.
It was quite short and rather cold. It said simply
that he had been forced to undertake a voyage to the
Argentine and that he regretted not having had a
chance to bid his beloved Anna farewell. He would
write her and see her on his return. But she knew
well enough that it was the end. Voyez, c‚Äôest elk la
vietlle Princesse!</p>
<p>For two days she was not seen and on the third
day she left Venice mysteriously and appeared with
equal mystery in Brinoe, where she quickly set about
restoring and preparing the Villa Leonardo. Because
It was lonely and because it was in a state of ruin, it
had been waiting for years a purchaser who saw its
virtues. With a kind of mad vitality she attacked
the refitting of the villa. Masons came and plumb-
ers and painters. To Margharita and the other
servants who lived on the place it all seemed a
strange proceeding for one who was simply prepar-</p>
<p>292 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>ing a spot where she might retire from the world.
Four bathrooms were installed and much furniture,
not furniture like that Mrs. Weatherby had strewn
about during her tenancy, but expensive and beauti-
ful pieces that should have been in museums. The
old chapel was opened again and put in order for
religious ceremonies. There was such a confusion
as the old villa had not seen since the great days of
the Spanish Ambassador. And at last when the
Principessa came herself (dressed handsomely all in
black by Worth) to examine the progress of the
work she asked what had become of the statue they
found in the garden, and Margharita told her that
it had been buried again. The Principessa herself
superintended the reopening of the grave, but they
dug and dug without ever finding a trace of the
statue and at last Margharita confessed that she
knew all along it was not there. It had already been
dug up a second time and carted down the hillside
where it was set up in the barren rocky little garden
of Pietro the goatherd. The Principessa flew into
a wild rage and said that the statue was her own and
that she meant to have It. She herself went to
Pietro‚Äôs hut to recover it.</p>
<p>And when the palace was finished Anna d‚ÄôOrobelli
drove one day into Brinoe and sought out Father
d‚ÄôAstier to show him the place she had prepared
for her retirement-</p>
<p>It was a warm day in April when the hillside
beyond Monte Salvatore was blue with violets and
wild hyacinths and the whole valley, that was by
nature so bleak and barren, had turned fresh and
green from the thin stream at the bottom to the wild</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>293</p>
<p>woods on its crest. But in her Black and red motor
the Princess drove so fast that it was impossible to
appreciate the beauties of the burgeoning country-
side. They entered the villa by the main door and
went from room to room, from the great salon
with the anatomical paintings to the tiny room in the
top fitted as a cell, with a hard iron bed, a crucifix
and a wooden bench, where Anna d‚ÄôOrobelH planned
to retire for days at a time in prayer. They had
very few words to say to each other. Father
d‚ÄôAstier from time to time murmured banal com-
pliments upon her taste and the Princess showed the
rooms with indifference as if it w&rsquo;ere a duty, as if
she were saying all the while, ‚ÄúIt is because of you
that I have come to this. It is because of you that
I must end my life in barren loneliness here in this
solitary villa.‚Äù When he asked her why she had
troubled to put in so many bathrooms, she replied
that she thought God would not mind if sometimes
she had friends come to stop with her, and Father
d‚ÄôAstier murmured that he supposed God would not
mind, though that was scarcely the Church‚Äôs idea of
a religious retirement.</p>
<p>When they had finished the house, they went
down into the garden. The colonnades of plane
trees were no longer yellow and brown as they had
been nine months earlier when they last walked to-
gether in the garden. The whole place was cov-
ered by a canopy of fresh green leaves that in the
spring sunlight appeared luminous, giving off a pure
green light. The roses that climbed over the
ancient stone balustrade above the valley were cov-
ered with white and yellow blossoms.</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>294</p>
<p>Once Anna d‚ÄôOrobelli said, ‚ÄúThis is a haunted
garden. Margharita says at night they sometimes
hear sounds of sin^ng and dancing although the
place is quite empty. It was the ghosts that drove
away that preposterous Mrs. Weatherby. I don‚Äôt
mind that. I‚Äôve never been afraid of ghosts.‚Äù</p>
<p>They found themselves suddenly at the end of one
of the colonnades before a niche let recently into
the mouldering wall. It was a niche such as one
finds in the gardens of Italy sheltering images of the
Virgin, only the image was not that of the interced-
ing Mary but of a figure more ancient. It was the
statue that had been dug up out of the cesspool.
On the slab of stone beneath it there was an inscrip-
tion. Father d‚ÄôAstier had need to read only the
first line to know what it was.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDans la damnation le feu est la moindre chose;
le supplice propre au damne est le progres infini
dans le vice et dans le crime, I‚Äôdme s‚Äôendurcissant, se
depravant toujours, s‚Äô enfoncant necessairement dans
le m.al de minute en progression geometrique
pendant VeterniteJ‚Äô</p>
<p>Michelet.</p>
<p>He turned away in silence and in silence they
walked back to the villa and entering the motor,
drove back again at a mad speed down the long
hill through Monte Salvatore into Brinoe. They
had talked a little but they had said nothing with
words. It was the silence which spoke for them.</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>295</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>Father d‚ÄôAstier never saw her again, and after
that people said that he had suddenly grown old.
The women whom he had once entertained by his
wit and helped with his wordly advice and solaced
by his spiritual comfort no longer found him either
interesting or good company. He ceased to be
amused by their vanities and even while they were
talking to him his gaze would have a strange way of
wandering off as if in search of something or some-
one whom he would never find. At times he would
pull himself up with a great effort and try again to
be what he had once been, but in the end he was too
weary. People who had once included him in din-
ners and week-ends began to neglect him. He went
about bravely as usual in search of converts, follow-
ing the season from London to Venice, to Paris, to
Vienna, but clearly there was no longer any heart in
his journeys.</p>
<p>And so he came one night in July to be staying
with the head of a great English Roman Catholic
family. There had been people for dinner and after
dinner, feeling a hunger to be alone, he withdrew
into the great library where the old Duke kept his
famous collection. There he left the other men and
hid himself behind a great globe mounted in silver
and mahogany to turn quietly, half-dreaming, the
pages of an eighteenth century translation of Hor-
ace. And presently when he had wearied of reading
he allowed the book to slip into his lap and sat with
his eyes closed. It was through the mists of sleep
that he became aware of the voices.</p>
<p>‚Äô i</p>
<p>&lsquo;i i</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>296 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>Two men had seated themselves on the opposite
side of the globe and were talking. One of them
was English and the other spoke with an Italian
accent. The Italian, he knew, was the cousin of
Faustino d‚ÄôOrobelli. He was a middle-aged man
and rich with the profits of an automobile factory.
The Englishman he thought must be Admiral Burn-
ham, whom he had not seen in more than twenty
years until tonight ‚Äî ^not, he thought, since he had
gone to Malta on Nina‚Äôs yacht on the voyage that
ended in meeting Anna.</p>
<p>The two men were gossipping. He heard the
Italian say, ‚ÄúAfter all, my cousin Faustino was never
much of a husband for a woman like that.‚Äù And
‚ÄúShe has kept remarkably young. She is quite ex-
traordinary.‚Äù</p>
<p>And then the Englishman answering. ‚ÄúI knew
her when she was first married. I met her in Malta.
Do you remember her?‚Äù</p>
<p>The voice of the Italian. ‚ÄúThat was a long time
ago. Even her second son, . . . the one who is
quite all right &hellip; is a grown man. But I hear
she has come to the same end as most of them.‚Äù</p>
<p>There was a sound of the admiral stirring in his
chair, as if he were sitting up with interest.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe‚Äôs found someone to console her,‚Äù continued
the Italian voice. . . . ‚ÄúA young Italian. He calls
himself a duke, but there are so many dukes. He
makes ends meet by gambling. . . .‚Äù There was a
slight pause, and then, ‚ÄúBy doing what he can. But
he won‚Äôt need to worry for some time. She‚Äôs very
rich. It was her money that saved Faustino‚Äôs
family. She‚Äôs an odd woman. She has no sense of</p>
<p>f</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 297</p>
<p>the value of money. It‚Äôs lucky she‚Äôs always had so
much. She met the gigolo at Nina de Paulhac‚Äôs.‚Äù</p>
<p>The voice of the admiral sounded suddenly gruff
and ill-tempered. ‚ÄúI could never see why Nina has
such people about.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe has a list of them, for dances and week-ends.</p>
<p>When a woman gets to be Nina‚Äôs age, young men
don‚Äôt flock about for love.‚Äù</p>
<p>There was a pause and Father d‚ÄôAstier was aware
that he must be very still lest they discover that he
was sitting there, for he knew that two men will
gossip and say things of a woman that they would
not say if a third were present. Honor to which
he himself had sacrificed so much was, he thought,
an artificial thing, like the clothes one put on before
appearing in public. He found himself praying
that they would not speak of her again. And then
the voice of Faustino‚Äôs cousin.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey say that Oreste Fonterrabia went away on
her account.‚Äù I</p>
<p>‚ÄúYes, she was always reluctant to give up love.‚Äù</p>
<p>A sigh. ‚ÄúBut a magnificent woman.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe must remember w&rsquo;hat she was.‚Äù j</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am glad to have news of her. I haven‚Äôt seen 5</p>
<p>her in years.‚Äù</p>
<p>And then the cracked voice of the childish old \</p>
<p>duke moving toward them. ‚ÄúI think, gentlemen,
that we will join the ladies.‚Äù j</p>
<p>When they had gone Father d‚ÄôAstier replaced the !</p>
<p>volume of Horace, came out from his hiding place |</p>
<p>and fixing his mouth into a worldly smile went 1</p>
<p>through the big door into the drawing-room where i</p>
<p>the daughter of Admiral Burnham who was the half- j</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>298</p>
<p>sister of Victor d‚ÄôOrobelli was playing Chopin
quietly in the far corner. He noticed that she had
the same fine red hair and clear skin that Victor had.
She was young and very beautiful, and in his weari-
ness and confusion it seemed to him for a moment
that she might have been his own daughter if he had
chosen differently. He had only Fulco.</p>
<p>That night when he was alone again in his room
over the Georgian doorway that faced the park he
closed and locked his door and then sat down before
the fire they had made for him, because he some-
times had chills at night, even in July. All through
the interminable evening he had been thinking in the
back of his mind, behind all the talk and chatter and
the music made by the Burnham girl, of Fulco, and
he made the astounding discovery that Fulco hadn‚Äôt
any longer the power of irritating him. He had
begun to think of Fulco as Poor Fulco in the way he
thought of Anna as Poor Anna. That meant, he
knew, that he was really an old mart and at the end
of things. He saw that he alone was responsible
for Fulco‚Äôs very existence and that he had in a way
always shirked that responsibility. He saw poor
Fulco in his checked suit and umbrella wandering
from village to village in Italy, trying to ‚Äúpurify
Christianity,‚Äù and trying to free it of all the cen-
turies of tiresome accumulations and growths. Fulco
who hadn‚Äôt the power or the dignity or the presence
to convince anyone of anything. Fulco attempting
a new Reformation. &hellip;</p>
<p>He turned away from the fire and began to un-
dress. His hands trembled a little, like those of a
very old man. They had never trembled before.</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>299</p>
<p>He was tired, but not too tired to make a resolution.
He would go back to Italy tomorrow and go from
town to town, searching out Fulco, and when he had
found Fulco he would reason with him to return
to the Church. He would even use his influence to
help him and he would tell Fulco that he was his
son and the only relative who remained in the world.
Together they would perhaps work something out
and when that was done he would retire into the
monastery at Monte Salvatore and never come out
again, not even in death. They could bury him in
the end in the warm sunny garden above the valley.
The old conflict in his ravaged soul seemed dead at
last. The Church was his mother to whom he might
return now that he had finished with life. The
world had nothing better to offer. And he was
tired of this world,</p>
<p>VI</p>
<p>He left suddenly saying that he had been called
back to Brinoe on business of the Church. It was in
Bologna while his train was awaiting the train from
Venice that he bought the newspaper and read the
small paragraph at the bottom of the page. In
Milan, said the paper, a man later identified as
a renegade priest named Baldessare had been found
on a street comer preaching Communism, and
twelve vigilant and heroic young men in black shirts
had pulled him down from the steps where he was
speaking and beaten him and dosed him with castor
oil. The offender had died the same night of his
injuries. ‚ÄúIt is by such vigilance and heroic con-</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>300</p>
<p>duct,‚Äù read the last florid sentence of the brief ac-
count, ‚Äúthat our leader and our sacred Italy are
preserved daily from the corruptions of those who
would destroy both. It is hoped that the watchful
young men wiU be properly rewarded for their
service.‚Äù</p>
<p>Father d‚ÄôAstier closed his eyes and leaned back
in the heat of the compartment. ‚ÄúCommunism,‚Äù he
thought. ‚ÄúPoor Fulco had probably never heard
of Communism.‚Äù They had killed him for preach-
ing what Christ taught.</p>
<p>In another day they would have made him a mar-
tyr and a saint.</p>
<p>That night when he arrived at Brinoe he went to
the two bare small rooms and taking a few books
from them he locked the door, and hiring a fiacre,
drove up the long hill to Monte Salvatore. They
were awaiting him for he had sent a telegram ahead
from Bologna. Inside the monastery they told him
that the Principessa d‚ÄôOrobelli had not returned to
the Villa Leonardo. She had leased it, they said,
to some English people named Winnery who were
recently married. For a moment Father d‚ÄôAstier
wondered whether it could be the pompous and com-
mon little man he had met on the day they found
the statue in the garden, and then he told himself
that a man like Mr. Winnery would scarcely be en-
joying a honeymoon at his age. From the window
of his room high up in the monastery above the
house of Signora Bardelli, Father d‚ÄôAstier could
see the distant lights of the villa twinkling like stars
in the darkness. He knew what he had known all
along, that she would never return there.</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>301</p>
<p>MR. WINNERY‚ÄôS PRIVATE MIRACLE</p>
<p>S O It was Mr. and Mrs. Winnery (nee Fos-
dick) who were destined In the end to use the
four bathtubs Installed by the Princess d‚ÄôOrobelli for
her retirement from the world. The very face of the
villa had been changed and the bleak, barren and
mournful air which once had invested It was gone
forever. Like the countenances of ladies who have
had their faces lifted it appeared new and pleasant
without losing altogether its engaging air of an-
tiquity and experience. The garden was all In order
now and where only sour and brilliant green moss had
once grown there were now banks of flowers which
actually grew wdth all the extravagance described in
the tourist circulars on the subject of Brinoe. And
Mr. Winnery, now that he was no longer forced to
live In Brinoe, found It a lovely place. In the long
summer twilights he and the pregnant Mrs. Win-
nery walked slowly up and down the long colonnades
of mottled plane trees talking together in sudden
bird-like bursts of intimacy of the days before they
were brought together by the death and the miracle
of Miss Annie Spragg. Neither of them had ever
known any intimacy before and its discovery en-
chanted them.</p>
<p>She also told him a great deal more about Aunt
Henrietta, each day thinking up fresh horrors to
relate. She expressed surprise at the fact that Aunt
Henrietta had never found him guilty of improper</p>
<p>302 THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>or suggestive advances. It was a kind of madness
with her; Aunt Henrietta always believed that men
were making Improper remarks in her presence or
staring at her or attempting flirtations. It was true,
said Gertrude Winnery, that the seeress had been
pinched once In the museum of Pompeii by a
guide who had seen her only from the rear. There
had been a tremendous and most embarrassing scene
until her honor was vindicated by the arrest of the
terrified little man, who discovered abruptly that he
had pinched a tornado. Yes, thought Mrs. Winnery,
she was a little mad on the subject of her attrac-
tions.</p>
<p>On their return Mr. Winnery took for his study
the room which the seeress had called her boudoir,
and there he installed four large crates of confused
notes, copyings and false starts which represented
Miracles and Other Natural Phenomena. In this
room he spent morning after morning struggling to
bring order out of chaos while Mrs. Winnery occu-
pied herself with the delights of keeping house for
herself, instead of someone else. But his heart
seemed to fail him and the combative Interest which
had once animated the colossal work appeared to
have suffered a decline. At length, In despair, as if
he had been a writer of detective mysteries, who
must somehow bring the story to a close, he made a
summary of the facts and information for and
against the miraculous element in the case of Miss
Annie Spragg. It included all the information he
had been able to collect both in Brinoe and Winne-
bago Falls. It seemed the only way to end the
whole muddle.</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>303</p>
<p>He began by setting down the elements which ap-
peared to him to be subject to a reasonable explana-
tion. He wrote :</p>
<ol>
<li>The Church appears to have been entirely
right in quietly discrediting the so-called miracle.</li>
</ol>
<p>The scars on the body of Miss Annie Spragg
appear neither to have been of miraculous ori-
gin nor to have appeared at the moment of her
death, but clearly were the scars of wounds in-
flicted upon her at some time before the brutal
murder of her brother at Winnebago Falls. It
is on record that they were seen at the time of
her examination in connection with the murder.</p>
<p>The agency which inflicted the wounds will prob-
ably never be known, although it seems likely</p>
<p>that they were inflicted by her brother. Reverend ‚ñ†‚ñ†</p>
<p>Uriah Spragg, a religious fanatic, as a punish-
ment for some sin she had committed and in the
hope of redeeming her soul. (See old Puritan ;</p>
<p>law for the branding of women caught in adul-
tery.) I</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The Church also appears to have been f</li>
</ol>
<p>right in its quiet assumption that the visitation '</p>
<p>of Saint Francis to Sister Annunziata was not</p>
<p>of a miraculous character but only an hallucina-
tion due to her period of life and to definite
physical causes together with the discovery of ];</p>
<p>what to her poor weak mind appeared to be evi- ?</p>
<p>dence of the miraculous and authentic Stigmata. i</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>On the surface there appears to be noth-
ing which might indicate that Miss Annie Spragg</li>
</ol>
<p>was anything but an eccentric old maid of the i</p>
<p>304</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>kind found frequently enough in small towns
and religious communities. It must be remem-
bered that she was the daughter of Cyrus
Spragg, the Prophet, and the sister of Uriah
Spragg. The one was an over-sexed and lecher-
ous old man and the other a religious fanatic.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>The story of Bestia and the strange hap-
penings there with Peppina and the goats may
be explained, if they ever occurred at all, sim-
ply as the eccentricities of a half-mad old woman,
magnified and embellished by the imaginations
of superstitious and ignorant peasants and of a
woman (Signora Bardelli, the janitress) who
was, either sincerely or insincerely, a devotee of
the Black Arts. That Miss Annie Spragg w‚Äòas in
any way responsible for the subsequent behavior
of the girl Peppina seems unlikely. The charac-
ter of the girl from childhood was clearly that of
an epileptic and a moral imbecile and of one des-
tined from birth to end her career in a brothel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The testimony of the nun Sister Annun-
ziata and the priest Father Baldessare (later
killed in a riot in Milan where he was mistaken
by Fascists for a Communist) is highly unreli-
able owing to the unbalanced character of the
nun‚Äôs mind and the general stupidity of the priest
who appears to have been the dupe of various
people throughout his life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The brutal murder of Reverend Uriah
Spragg could have been committed by a passing
tramp or by one of his own flock in a fit of
hatred or religious insanity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The apparently miraculous disappearance</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>of Cyrus Spragg, th*e Prophet, from the Temple
at New Jerusalem lends itself to a much simpler
solution than that put forth by his son Obadiah
(that he was carried to heaven in a chariot of
fire ) , It seems more likely that he was killed
by the hot-blooded suitor of the pretty Maria
Weatherby and that his body was buried se-
cretly the same night by his two elder sons who
then endeavored to carry out an imposture for
the continued profit of themselves and their
brothers and sisters, (In this they failed
through a lack of the Pi&rsquo;opliet‚Äôs vigor.) There
is no evidence of an effort made to find and bring
to justice the Kentuckian, Alonzo. Such a pro-
cedure would possibly have been embarrassing
to the impostors by establishing the fact that the
Prophet really was dead.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
<p>The behavior of Shamus Bosanky and the
visions he had may be explained as due to epi-
lepsy, of which he was clearly a victim. There
is nothing unusual in his visions of Heaven, God,
Saint John the Shepherd and the Angels, for he
had heard of all these things from the priests
and from old Mary Bosanky, who was of a
strongly superstitious and religious tempera-
ment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There Is nothing unusual in Miss Annie
Spragg‚Äôs choice of Italy as a place of retreat
after the death of her brother. Italy Is filled
with eccentric old ladies whose youth was starved
for all the romantic and operatic background
which Italy^ supplies with such extravagances.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Conclusion. All of these elements seem to</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>3o6 the strange CASE OF</p>
<p>fall within the category of the natural and ap-
pear strange only as they are subject to the
imaginations, the prejudices and the superstitions
of the various witnesses involved.</p>
<p>On the other hand (wrote Mr. Winnery) , there
are certain elements which do not lend themselves
to any reasonable solution. Among these are,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The statement of the undertaker of
Winnebago Falls that the wounds on the body
of Reverend Uriah Spragg were like those
which might have been made by some pronged
instrument such as the sharp horns of a goat.
The skull had been pierced in three places by
some sharp instrument. But it must be remem-
bered that the black he-goat of Miss Annie
Spragg was already dead at the time of the mur-
der, having been killed that very morning by
Uriah Spragg himself with a hatchet. Together
with this element, there is also the fact that al-
though the murder was committed on the open
prairie in broad daylight with no shelter of any
kind nearer than three miles and that although
the body was. still warm when found by Maria
Hazlett, on one was seen and no trace of anyone
was ever discovered near the spot. Nor was any
weapon ever found.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The story told by Shamus Bosanky to Ed
Hasselman and Maria Hazlett of the orgies
which took place in the marsh at Meeker‚Äôs
Gulch. Shamus Bosanky had heard of God and
the Angels and the Saints from the priests and</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 307</p>
<p>from his mother, but it seems impossible that he
had ever heard of pagan gods either from the
priests or from a mother who could neither read
nor write. Therefore he could scarcely ha&rsquo;v‚Äô&rsquo;e
imagined such a story, save by some obscure and
scarcely believable trick of atavism. Nor does
it seem possible that the story was invented by
the woman Maria Hazlett, who, brought up in
a poorhouse and scarcely able to read or write,
had certainly never heai&rsquo;d of Dionysus or Bac-
chus. The Hazlett woman, now nearly seventy
years old, appears to be a simple countrywoman
with an extraordinary attachment for the soil
and for the drunken old man to whom she de-
voted her entire life.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>The incident of Miss Annie Spragg‚Äôs re-
turn at dawn from Meeker‚Äôs Gulch accompanied
by the black he-goat. This could be said to have
been only the hallucination of the drunken milk-
man but for the discovery in the bedroom of
Miss Annie Spragg of the chains and the crude
handcuffs with which her brother chained her up
at night.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that from among all the saints
Shamus Bosanky chose instinctively as his patron
Saint John the Shepherd.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most singular and, astonishing fact of
all, that Shamus Bosanky ran out into the storm
to meet his death at the very moment when Miss
Annie Spragg lay dying in the Palazzo Gon-
farini on the other side of the world. Her own
death occurred in the early morning of the fif-
teenth of August. At midnight of the four-</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>3o8 the strange CASE OF</p>
<p>teenth Shamus Bosanky vanished into the storm
from the shanty by the railroad in Winnebago
Falls. It appears that he went directly to
Meeker‚Äôs Gulch as to a rendezvous, for it was
here that he was found later by the Hazlett
woman, who alone seems to have known where
to look for him. Allowing for the difference in
time between Brinoe and Winnebago Falls, the
deaths must have occurred at almost the same
moment. {Note. This fact leads one to be-
lieve that if the elements of time and space were
always taken into consideration in such cases
there might emerge a whole and very strange
new world filled with undiscovered relation-
ships.)</p>
<p>Note. Many other minor and contributory
incidents have by the passage of time been lost
in an obscurity from which it is scarcely possible
to resurrect them for proper scientific examina-
tion. Among these may be noted the origins of
the Prophet, Cyrus Spragg, and the strange dis-
appearance of Michael Bosanky, in the so-called
bottomless pond at Lakeville, Iowa.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>One other curious fact came to light some time
after Mr. Winnery had established himself at the
Villa Leonardo. He had been walking one morning
in the garden after breakfast turning over and over
in his mind the puzzling evidence he had just set
down on paper, when he found himself suddenly be-
fore the statue, reading with some dim portion of</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>309 I</p>
<p>his mind the inscription which began, ‚ÄúDans la dam- :,|</p>
<p>nation le feu est la moindre chose, etc., etc.‚Äô^ All at ||</p>
<p>once he was aware that the face of the statue pos- il</p>
<p>sessed a similarity to the face of someone he had &lsquo;I</p>
<p>known in life, and for a long time he stood there .1</p>
<p>studying the sensual and vigorous countenance, at- |</p>
<p>tempting to relate it to some face which hovered !'|</p>
<p>elusively as a ghost in the back of his consciousness. |</p>
<p>And then all at once he turned sharply about and |</p>
<p>hastened back to his study where he took down from
a box a faded daguerreotype. Armed with this he
descended again to the garden and stood for a long
time comparing the face in the daguerreotype with
that of Priapus, God of Fertility.</p>
<p>When he returned at last to the villa, he took up
his note book and made in it the last entry he was
ever to make in the strange case of Miss Annie
Spragg.</p>
<p>The strangest of all the facts (he wrote) is
the likeness between the face of the statue found
in the garden of the Villa Leonardo and the
face in the daguerreotj‚Äôpe portrait made of
Cyrus Spragg on the day the Prophet retired
into the temple at New Jerusalem, never to be
seen again by any man. The daguerreotype
(secured by the author after much difficulty from
the daughter of one of the original Spraggites
and therefore possibly a daughter of the Prophet
himself) has faded with age, but not sufficiently
to weaken the certainty that the face of Cyrus
Spragg, the Prophet, and the face of the image
of Priapus are the same face.</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>310</p>
<p>And then half-credulously, he added, ‚ÄúPerhaps
the story told by the Prophet‚Äôs son, Obadiah Spragg,
was true. Perhaps Cyrus Spragg simply disap-
peared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ill</p>
<p>He told Mrs. Winnery that the whole affair ap-
peared hopelessly muddied and inexplicable, and
that the solution was scarcely worth any further ex-
penditure of his valuable time. Secretly he had a
sense of it pointing toward something but what this
was he could not say. He did not tell Mrs. Win-
nery that in attempting to solve one mystery he had
simply confronted another and more terrifying one
which neither scientists nor prophets nor saints had
ever solved in all the centuries of the world‚Äôs re-
corded existence. It made Mr. Winnery seem to
himself small and insignificant and impertinent, and
being a vain man, he did not care to have his wife
share this discovery.</p>
<p>Out of ail the muddle only one thing seemed to
emerge clearly ‚Äî ^that there was in the affair the evi-
dence of some colossal struggle between all that was
Christian and all that which Signora Bardelli de-
scribed as ‚Äúolde-r than the church, older than Chris-
tianity itself‚Äù and that humanity was the battle
ground upon which the two ancient elements waged
their colossal and endless conflict. The Church of
Rome, he thought (though he did not confide this
even to Mrs. Winnery) , was right just as it had been
right in the question of Miss Annie Spragg‚Äôs</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG 311</p>
<p>spurious mirade. It appeared to attempt a com-
promise.</p>
<p>He had discovered that a Primitive Methodist
had been buried in consecrated ground by mistake
but only he knew this for a certainty and he saw no
reason to disturb the eternal rest of a poor eccentric
old maid. Besides, such a thing did not seem to
him to be a matter of any great importance. He
bowed before the mystery and, feeling somewhat
ashamed of himself for his impertinence, packed
away in crates in the cellar of the Villa Leonardo,
the vast accumulation of notes, copyings and false
starts which represented Miracles and Other Nat-
ural Phenomena. This cellar he found, as he had
supposed, to be of Etruscan construction.</p>
<p>But the next day he began with singular energy a
new work. This time it was not a scientific under-
taking but a historical romance teeming with local
color. It was called Riccardo and Giuliana and
the setting was Brinoe in the time of the Renais-
sance. The hero, Riccardo, was a man, fifty-three
years old, who had spent his life In the service of the
Dukes of Brinoe. The heroine, Giuliana, was a
young girl of thirty-five who had been kept a
prisoner since childhood in a lonely villa in the val-
ley behind Monte Salvatore by an aunt who con-
cealed a taste for sadism beneath a reputation for
great piety. Among the subsidiary characters were
MIchangelo, Leonardo, Machiavellia, Lucrezia
Tuornabuoni, Lorenzo the Magnificent, Cesare and
Lucrezia Borgia, Botticelli, Fra Lippo Lippi (who
supplied the comic relief) and a few others. In the</p>
<p>THE STRANGE CASE OF</p>
<p>312</p>
<p>end Riccardo rescued Giuliana and they were mar-
ried amid celebrations in which the joyous and care-
free natives of Brinoe and all the foreigners living
there took part. He told Mrs. Winnery that he
thought he had found at last the proper medium for
the expression of his literary talents. During the
last month or two of her pregnancy he read aloud to
her chapter after chapter as they were completed.</p>
<p>She was confined six weeks earlier than they had
expected. It was the month of October when the
goatherd Pietro kept a perpetual heap of offerings
before the statue in the garden and it was Sister
Annunziata who brought him, pacing up and down
in the ancient garden, before the statue, the news
that he was the father of twin boys. They no
longer kept Sister Annunziata shut up because her
madness seemed of a harmless nature and madness
was a thing never taken seriously in Italy. She
simply believed that Miss Annie Spragg was an un-
appreciated saint and that Saint Francis was her
guardian and companion day and night. In a vague
gesture of gratitude toward the pagan gods of fer-
tility, Mr. Winneiy made a rich gift of money to
Sister Annunziata‚Äôs convent. It was used to restore
abominably a series of famous frescoes by Gozzoli,
which had faded almost into oblivion. So in the
end Aunt Bessie‚Äôs money came to embellish a non-
conformist chapel in Bloomsbury and a Roman
Catholic convent in Brinoe.</p>
<p>Mr. Winnery has completed his romance, for
which he was granted the very rare honor of an in-
terview with the Dictator and he has been made a</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>313</p>
<p>Knight of the Order of Saint Trevizius and a mem-
ber of three societies of historical research having to
do with Brinoe. Mrs. Winnery is about to have a
third child and they are very happy in the Villa
Leonardo and are likely to remain its tenants for
years to come, for the retirement of the Principessa
d‚ÄôOrobelli grows each year more and more remote
in its possibilities. The statue in the garden has
never troubled them as it troubled others because
they are by nature a pair of innocents.</p>
<p>Often as they drive happily into Brinoe, with the
nurse and the twins on the seat opposite them, they
pass the house of Signora Bardelli, lying close
against the wall of the monastery, where Father
d‚ÄôAstier sought refuge. The retired janitress does
a splendid business with the bed of Miss Annie
Spragg and has grown quite rich. There has even
been talk of offering her a medal for her efforts in
behalf of the apparently new but really ancient
movement toward greater fertility of Italy. Mr.
and Mrs. Winnery bow to greet* her pleasantly, for
Mr. Winnery came in the end to the conviction that
any belief which brought comfort to the human race
had its own place in the divine scheme of things.</p>
<p>Frequently the Winnerys drive to the Campo
Santo of Monte Salvatore to carry flowers from the
garden of the Villa Leonardo to the grave of Miss
Annie Spragg. They have never forgotten that
their meeting was due to her and they are grateful
to her for so much happiness. They always find
there other flowers and sometimes branches of
green olives and even melons and fruit, for there</p>
<p>3^4</p>
<p>MISS ANNIE SPRAGG</p>
<p>remain scores and even hundreds among the poor
and humble and superstitious who continue stub-
bornly to regard her as a saint.</p>
