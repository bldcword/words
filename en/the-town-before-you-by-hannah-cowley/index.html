<p>PREFACE.</p>
<p>T  H  E  following  is  rather  the  Comedy  which  the
Public  have  chofen  it  to  be,  than  the  Comedy  which  I
intended.  Some  things  have  been  left  out,  and  fome
have  been  added  fince  the  firft  reprefentation  :  In  fhort,
the  Comedy  has  been  ntw  clffs‚Äôd‚Äî~lt  has  been  torn  from
its  genus.</p>
<p>It  is  hoped,  however,  that  there  may  be  found  cha¬¨
racters,  in  The  Town  Before  You,  to  intereft,
and  fituations  to  attach;  and  that  thofe  events  which
were  vivacity  ip  the  Theatre,  will  not  be  dulnefs  ir\
the  clofet.</p>
<p>But  it  muff  be  noticed,  that  the  feene,  in  the  fecond
a¬£t,  between  Tippy  and  his  Landlady,  and  that  in  the
fifth  aCI,  between  Tippy  and  the  Bailiff,  were  no  part
of.  my  original  defign.  They  were  written  during  the
illnefs  of  Mrs.  Pope,  after  the  Piece  had  been  played
feveral  nights.  Alas  !  I  am  lorry  to  remark,  that  no
feenes  in. the  Comedy  (to  ufe  the  Stage  idiom)  go  off
better*  .  *</p>

<p>PREFACE.</p>
<p>An  acute  Critic  lately  faid,  in  one  of  thofe  aflemblies
where  converfation,  though  fometimes  light,  is  feldom
without  meaning,  tc  A  Comedy  to  pleafe,  in  the  prefent
day,  mult  be  madey  not  written It  requires  no  great
expanfe  of  comprehenfion  to  perceive  the  meaning  of
this  dogma ;  the  truth  of  which  I  am  equally  ready  to
acknowledge,  and  to  deplore:  But  fhould  it  want  illus¬¨
tration,  it  may  be  found  every  week  in  a  popular
Piece,  where  a  great  Adlor,  holding  a  fword  in  his  left
hand,  and  making  aukward  pulhes  with  it,  charms  the
audience  infinitely  more  than  he  could  do,  by  all  the
wit  and  obfervation  which  the  ingenious  Author  might
have  given  him;  and  brings  down  fuch  applaufes,  as
the  bewitching  dialogue  of  Cibber,  and  of  Far-
Quhar  pants  for  in  vain  !</p>
<p>The  patient  developement  of  character,  the  repeated
touches  which  colour  it  up  to  Nature,  and  fwell  it  into
identity  and  exigence  (and  which  gave  celebrity  to
Congreve),  we  have  now  no  relifh  for.  The  com¬¨
binations  of  intereft,  the  ftrokes  which  are  meant  to&rsquo;
reach  the  heart,  we  are  equally  incapable  of  tailing.
Laugh!  Laugh  !  Laugh  !  is  the  demand:  Not  a
word  mull  be  uttered  that  looks  like  inflrudion,  or  a
fentence  which  ought  to  be  remembered.</p>
<p>From  a  Stage,  in  fuch  a  ftate,  it  is  time  to  with-
diaw;  but  I  call  on  my  younger  cotemporaries,  I  in¬¨
voke  the  rifing  generation,  to  correct  a  tafte  which,</p>
<p>to  be  gratified,  demands  neither  genius  or  intellect ; _</p>
<p>which  afks  only  a  happy  knack  at  inventing  trick.
I  adjure  them  to  reft  ore  to  the  Drama  sense,  obser¬¨
vation,</p>
<p>PREFACE.</p>
<p>XI</p>
<p>va&rsquo;tion,  wit,  lesson  !  and  to  teach  our  Writers  to
refpect  their  own  talents.</p>
<p>What  mother  can  now  lead  her  daughters  to  the
great  National  School,  the  I  heatre,  in  the  confi¬¨
dence  of  their  receiving  either  poliih  or  improvement  ?
Should  the  iucklefs  Bard  {tumble  on  a  reflection,  or  a
fentiment,  the  audience  yawn,  and  wait  for  the  next
tumble  from  a  chair,  or  a  tripping  up  of  the  heels,  to
put  them  into  attention.  Surely  I  ftiali  be  forgiven  foi
fatirifing  myfell ;  I  have  made  luch  things,  and  I  blufh
to  have  made  them.</p>
<p>O  !  Genius  of  a  polifh‚Äôd  age,  defeend  ! - plant  thy</p>
<p>banners  incur  1  heatres,  and  bid  elegance  and  feel¬¨
ing  take  place  of  the  droll  and  the  laugh ,  which  formerly
were  found  only  in  the  Bootns  of  Bartlemy  b  air,  and
were  divided  between  Flocton  and  Tates  !  With  actors
capable  of  giving  force  to  all  that  is  intellectual,  is  it  not
pity  to  condemn  them  to  fuch  drudgery?  1  hey  are  no
longer  necefiary.  Let  Sadler‚Äôs  Wells  and  the  Circus
empty  themfelves  of  their  performers  tofurniih  our  Stage;
the  expence  to  Managers  will  be  Its,  and  their  buftnefs
will  be  carried  on  better,  the  understanding,
discernment,  and  education,  which  diftinguifh  our
modern  actors,  are  ufelefs  to  them ; ‚Äî ft rong  mufcles  are  in
greater  repute,  and  grimace  has  more  powerful  attraction.</p>

<p>PROLOGUE,</p>

<p>Ah!  ah  !  you‚Äôre  here,  and  comfortably  tight?</p>
<p>Well  fqueez‚Äôd  and  prefs‚Äôd,  I  fee‚Äî from  left  to  right,
Waiting  the  moment  when  the  curtain  nfes,</p>
<p>Gafping  for  plots,  adventures,  and  furprifes !</p>
<p>Were  I  a  Poet ‚Äî a  Dramatic  Wit,</p>
<p>And  by  the  Stage  Tarantula  were  bit.</p>
<p>My  Prologue  fhou‚Äôd,  as  was  the  good  old  way,</p>
<p>A  word  or  two  upon  the  fubjctt  fay\</p>
<p>Hint  a  loofe  outline  of  the  fcene  within.</p>
<p>And  let  you  guefs  the  whole  ere  we  begin.</p>
<p>In  prefent  times,  the  Prologue  and  its  Play,</p>
<p>Are  as  near  kin  as  Michaelmas  and  May‚Äî</p>
<p>Confin‚Äôd,  then,  not  to  fay  a  word  of  that ,</p>
<p>I‚Äôll  tell  a  dory‚Äî and  I  have  one  pat.</p>
<p>A  Boniface  of  late,  placed  near  his  door.</p>
<p>Good  larders  here,  of  genuine  wines,  rich  dore, 3
In  gold  the  gaudy  invitation  hung,</p>
<p>And  to  the  fhifting  Zephyrs  gently  fwung.</p>
<p>It  chanc‚Äôd  a  traveller,  with  ftomach  keen.</p>
<p>Leapt  from  his  Rozinante,  tir‚Äôd  arid  lean.</p>
<p>Talk‚Äôd  of  his  fupper,  with  an  eager  air ‚Äî</p>
<p>Refolved,  for  once,  in  no  expence  to  fpare  ;</p>
<p>I‚Äôll  have  dewed  carp,  he  cried,  and  chicken  road.
And,  bring  me,  of  the  Burgundy  you  boad.</p>
<p>y _ e‚Äî s,  Sir,  the  daring,  curtfying  Damfel  faid,</p>
<p>And,  in  a  trice,  the  table-cloth  was  laid.</p>
<p>J  am  my  own  man,  he  adds,  in  accents  bold,</p>
<p>PPvOLOCUE.</p>
<p>Nor  fhall  I  fear,  to-night,  my  houfehold  fcold  ;</p>
<p>One  hundred  miles,  betwixt  me  and  my  dear ‚Äî</p>
<p>Odds  bobs  !  her  llirill  alarum  can‚Äôt  reach  here  !</p>
<p>At  length  came  back  the  pretty,  fimpering  Kate,</p>
<p>And  plac‚Äôd ‚Äî two  eggs  upon  his  lonely  plate.</p>
<p>Our  Traveller  amazed,  the  Landlord  call‚Äôd,</p>
<p>Holt !  Hoft  !  in  angry  accents  loudly  bawi‚Äôd  ;</p>
<p>He  came ‚Äî Where  are  your  ducks,  your  lobfters,  turkey,</p>
<p>hare  ?</p>
<p>‚Äú  Why,  there  you  have  them ‚Äî in  the  Bill  of  Fare  ;
i(  There  you  have  game,  and  fowl,  and  fifh,  well  dreft..
And  neat  old  Port,  to  give  the  whole  a  zeft  ;</p>
<p>‚Äú  My  houfe  affords  no  other.  Sir,  believe  me,</p>
<p>‚Äú  I  fcorns,  I‚Äôm  hire,  to  go  for  to  deceive  ye.‚Äù</p>
<p>The  gueft  fatigued,  enraged,  the  Inn  forfook,</p>
<ul>
<li>And  the  road,  flowly,  to  another  took:</li>
</ul>
<p>There,  without  promife,  all  was  neat  and  clean.</p>
<p>His  food  was  wholefome,  and  his  room  not  mean.</p>
<p>So ‚Äî not  to  raife  high  hopes,  we  cannot  meet.</p>
<p>We  truft  this  night‚Äôs  plain  fare  is  frefh  and  fweet ;</p>
<p>And  fhou‚Äôd  you  like  the  drefling,  we  invite  ye.</p>
<p>To  come  as  often  as  the  difti  delights  ye ;</p>
<p>A  hearty  welcome  you  will  always  find,</p>

<p>Fancourt.</p>
<p>How  well  thofe  fellows  wrote,  thole  an-
tients !  How  finely  they  fatirize  the  rich,  and
what  refped  they  have  for  virtue  in  rags !  My
dear,  I  will  translate  the  pafifage‚Äî -off  hand  now,
d‚Äôye  hear,  offhand!  (rifes  and  reads )</p>
<p>*Cf  Poliarchus,  the  rich  Athenian,  wantoning  in
‚Äú  gluttony,  looks  with  contempt  on  the  poor
*&lt;  Callander :  Caffander  repofing  on  his  bed  of
‚Äú  ftraw,  thanks  the  Gods  that  he  has  health
‚Äú  and  virtue i  and  prays  to  be  preferved  from
&lt;f  the  misfortune  of  being  rich,  like  Poliarchus,
*¬£  whofe  floors  are  ftained  with  the  wine  of
drunkennefs,  and  whofe  filver  couch  is  con-
*f  ftantly  crowded  ty  phyficians.‚Äù</p>
<p>Mrs .  Fancourt.  Are  you  fure  that  is  a  juft</p>
<p>tranflation,  Mr.  Fancourt  ?</p>
<p>B  Mr .</p>
<p>i  THE  TOWN  BEFORE  YOU,</p>
<p>Mr.  Fancourt .  What,  Madam,  do  you  doubt
my  knowledge  of  Greek!  Some  people  can
hardly  read  Englifh  at  fight;  I  can  tranflate  at
fight,  thanks  to  the  milk  I  fuck‚Äôd  in  at  Oxford.
Dodtor  Johnfon  and  I,  were  both  Oxford  men.</p>
<p>. ‚Äî I  like  to  read  that  old  Quiz,  he  was  fo  fond
of  us  Oxford  fellows.  But  he  had  too  much
refpedt  for  riches ‚Äî he  liked  rich  people.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Fancourt.  To  fay  truth,  I  have  a  little  -
of  his  way  of  thinking.  I  had  never  much
refpedt  towards  thofe  Philofophers  who  are
always  throwing  farcafms  on  the  rich ‚Äî</p>
<p>Fancourt .  (interrupting)  I  do  maintain.  Ma¬¨
dam,  that  the  rich  are  the  vileft ‚Äî</p>
<p>Mrs.  Fancourt.  Gome,  come,  Mr.  Fancourt,
your  extravagancies  have  rendered  you  poor,
and  therefore  you  are  always  raving  thus,  and
pouring  your  philipics  on  people  of  fortune; ‚Äî as
though  vice  and  folly  could  only  be  found  in
palaces,  and  virtue  in  garrets.</p>
<p>Fancourt.  Hey  day !  Why  Ma‚Äôam ‚Äî why ‚Äî
Mrs.  Fancourt.  For  my  part,  I  believe  there
is  as  much  goodnefs  amongft  perfons  of  fortune,
as  amongft  the  poor ‚Äî and  I  do  not  fee  why  the
power  of  d  re  fling  elegantly,  and  living  in  well
educated  fociety,  fliould  debafe  the  heart,  or
weaken  the  underflanding.</p>
<p>Fancourt.  You  do  not  fee  !  why  you  are  the
greateft ‚Äî the  moil  abominable ‚Äî upon  my  foul,
you  are  the  mofl  provoking  fool  that  ever ‚Äî
Mrs.  Fancourt.  My  dear  Sir,  1  do  not  doubt
it ‚Äî you  have  repeated  thefe  opinions  too  often
for  me  not  to  be  convinced  of  their  juftice.
But  really  now,  .between  ourfelves  ( rijing  and
laying  down  her  work)  as  opinion  is  nothing</p>
<p>without</p>
<p>A  COMEDY.</p>
<p>without  example,  I  will  take  the  liberty  to  quote
ydurfelf  in  fupport  of  mine.</p>
<p>Fancourt.  Me  !  quote  me !</p>
<p>Mrs.  Fancourt.  Even  your  great  and  mighty
felf !  Mr.  Fancourt,  when  I  married  you,  you
were -not  poor-‚Äî not  10  poor  as  you  are  now;
and  I  think  at  that  time  you  had  no  particular
vices;  but  as  diffipation  has  brought  poverty
upon  you,  I  have  obferved  that  by  little  and
little  your  Fiallow  virtues  have  difappeared,</p>
<p>till‚Äî  &hellip;.  .  .  ,</p>
<p>Fancourt.  (impatiently)  ‚ÄôTill  what?</p>
<p>Mrs.  Fancourt.  Till  you  are  capable  of  al-
moft  any  adtion  that  will  not  endanger  your
neck.  Nay,  I  no  longer  mind  your  threaten¬¨
ing  looks ‚Äî I  am  fo  convinced  of  what  I  have
faid,  that  my  heart  feels  horror.</p>
<p>Fancourt.  TU  make  it  feel  fomething  elfe.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Fancourt.  Y  ou  cannot.  All  other  power
over  my  heart  is  over;  you  can  afflid  it  no
more!  But  obferve  my  .deduction.  I  date  you
to  yourfelf  as  a  proof  that  poverty  is  fometimes
the  fource  of  wickednels ;  and  that  fqualid
wretchednefs  is  as  capable  ofdebafmg  the  heart,
as  affluence  and  fplendor.</p>
<p>Fancourt.  Very  well,  woman!  very  well!
Fill  the  noife  of  that  child  there ‚Äî ( going  to  tbs
door)  what  an  odious  fqualing  it  keeps !</p>
<p>Mrs.  Fancourt.  It  is  not  eafy,  Mr.  Fancourt,
to  Fill  the  noife  of  children  who  are  hungry.
Though  they  are  the  children  of  the  firft  Mrs.
Fancourt,  it  pierces  my  heart  to  hear  them ‚Äî
why  will  you  not  do  fomething  to  get  bread  for</p>
<p>them  ?.  .  k</p>
<p>Fancourt.  What  would  you  have  me  do  ?  I
was  not  bred  to  Fand  behind  a  counter,  nor</p>

<p>to  cry  fC  Chairs  to  mend&rdquo;  in  the  ffreets.  You
know  all  that ‚Äî what  did  you  marry  me  for?</p>
<p>Mrs.  Fancourt.  Alas !  becaufe  I  loved  you.
The  fweetneis  of  your  manners  difguifed  the
emptinefs  of  your  heart.,  and  I  romantically
thought-  that  poverty  could  never  be  an  evil,
when  tw&lt;y  hearts  fondly  jhared  its  difficulties.
But  now^ ‚Äî permit  me  to  afk,  why  you  married
me?</p>
<p>Fancourt.  Becaufe  you  had  a  modicum  of  a
fortune ‚Äî a  fcore  of  hundreds :  and  I  had  not  fo
many  Shillings.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Fancourt.  That  little  modicum  might
have  been  a  bank,  if  properly  managed,  and ‚Äî ¬´‚ñ†
Fancourt.  Pffiaw! ‚Äî fluff!  I  hate  fuch  cant.

once  a  burning  mountain,  and  that  the  Ap

turn  my  wits  to  account ‚Äî I  can  make  money,</p>

out  a  handful  of  guineas  from  his  ftore  as  you
would  dip  a  bucket  into  a  wrell  ?  give  rr}e

But,  dear  Georgina,  the  warmth  of  thy  ima¬¨

<p>Conway.  Faith,  I  perceive  no  room  for  jefts.

get  me  into  a  dining  parlour,  or  a  wine  cellar.
I  pronounce  on  Paintings  and  Tokay ‚Äî on

<p>Mrs .  Fancourt .  Ajfetted  pleafantry,  Mr.  Fan-

The  converfation  which  has  palled  in  the  next

<p>Sir  Robert.  Never  a  word ‚Äî never  a  word.
Stared  as  though  I  had  been  a  new  caught
monlter.  I  had  not  changed  my  drefs,  though
he  had  changed  his.  The  difference  of  drefs
made  me  alrnoft  think  once,  that  I  might  be
miflaken ;  but  on  looking  again,  I  was  lure  of
my  man.</p>
<p>Fancourt .  Aye‚Äî pray  what  was  his  drefs.
Sir?</p>
<p>Sir  Robert.  Regimentals.</p>
<p>Fancourt.  Regimentals  ?  a  hint !  (fignificantly
afide )  O !  he  had  his  regimentals  on ‚Äî aye ‚Äî he
is  a  Colonel  in  the  Guards.  Rather  odd  not
fpeaking,  I  confefs;  but  a  man,  whofe  head
is  Huff&rsquo;d  with  the  bufinefs  of  all  Europe,  mull
be  forgiven  if  a  flight  acquaintance  flips  out
of  it.</p>
<p>Sir  Robert.  Why,  I  can  make  allowances,
Mr.  Fancourt;  I  remember  myfelf,  when  I
was  High  Sheriff  for  the  county,  I  once  pafled
an  acqaintance,  but  I  made  him  an  apology;
and.  Sir,  I  fhall  expect  an  apology  from  my
Lord,  for  not  returning  my  bow,  before  I  ad-
.vance  the  thoufand  pounds.  A  thoufand  pounds
is  money,  Mr.  Fancourt.</p>
<p>Fancourt .  It  is ‚Äî it  is.  Sir,  and  the  man  who
will  not  make  a  bow  {or  a  thoufand  pounds,
ought  never  to  poflefs  a  thoufand  pence  ( laughs

<p>treated  me  with  haughtinefs,  even  when  Ihe
believed  me  heir  to  profperity.</p>
<p>Conway.  Pride  and  lovelineis  ought  to  go

over  values  herfelf,  will  never  fink  too  low;
and  the  lady  of  whom  we  lpeak,  perhaps  loves
you.</p>
<p>Ajgill.  For  that  very  reafon,  I  will  not  again
appear  before  her.  I  am  too  proud  to  raife
a  confli¬£l  in  her  bofom  between  her  pride,  and
her  tendernefs,  and  to  owe  at  length,  perhaps,
to  her  compojfimy  the  acceptance  to  which  her

You  found  me  fprawling  at  your  feet‚Äî it  fhews
how  devoted  I  am  to  your  fervice.</p>
<p>Tippy ,  Sir  Robert,  I  have  often  heard  of  the
politenefs  of  the  Welch  gentlemen,  and  you
really  confirm  all  that  has  been  faid.  The  year
in  which  you  were  fberiff,  Sir  Robert,  was  fuch
a  year  of  fplendour  and  magnificence,  as  Gla-
morganfhire  will  long  remember.  We  heard
a  vaft  deal  of  it  at  Saint  James‚Äôs  ;  it  amufed  the
Royal  Circle  fora  month.</p>
<p>Sir  Robert.  Why,  my  lord,  I  did  my  heft  on
that  occafion.  When  I  was  high  fheriff  for
the  county,  I  neither  fpared  myfelf  or  my
purfe.  A  hanging  in  the  morning,  and  an  af-
lembly  at  night ;  giving  the  judges  a  dinner  to¬¨
day,  and  to-morrow  confulting  Jack  Ketch
about  a  new  gallows.  Such  a  variety  of  buff-

<p>Tippy.  Certainly,  certainly.  A  little  thing
happened  this  morning,  Sir  Robert,  which  has
given  me  pain.  You  addreffed  me  in  the  Park,
I  really  was,  at  that  moment,  throwing  over  in
my  mind  the  compact  between  Rufffa  and  Po¬¨
land.  In  ffiort,  i  had  aim  oft  determined  to  go
to  Saint  Peteriburgh,  ambaffador  myfelf ;  fori
think  one  or  two  points  might  be  reviled.  At

left  that  to  my  broker.  He  furnifhed  the  whole

<p>Lady  Horatia  (peeping  with  vexation).  O
dear !  I  tell  you,  I  hate  your  nephew  ?</p>
<p>Sir  Simon.  Do  you?  O,  you  woman  !  You
downright  woman  !  I  fee  how  it  is.  When
he  was  rich,  you  loved  him  ;  when  you  looked
forward  to  fine  equipage,  fplendour  and  ex¬¨
pence,  you  acknowledged  his  merits ;  but  now
that  you  have  heard  he  is  poor,  you  defpife
him.  O  !  woman,  woman  !</p>
<p>Lady  Horatia  ( with  heat).  Sir,  it  is  falfe.
You  injure  me  in  every  part  of  your  opinion.
When  he  was  rich,  he  never  knew  that  he  had
caufed  a  tender  thought  in  me  ;  it  was  only  his
poverty  that  made  my  paflion  break  out  with¬¨
out  difguife.  It  was  his  diftrefs  that  made  me
feel,  and  acknowledge  I  adore  him.</p>
<p>Sir  Simon.  What,  then,  you  do  love  him  ?</p>
<p>Lady  Horatia  ( much  confufed).  What  have  I
faid  ?</p>

Speak  on ;  you  now  talk  like  a  fenfible  wo¬¨

confelTion.  You,  his  fecond  father !  Mr.  AD
gill  has  twined  himfelf  into  my  foul  3  his  po¬¨
verty  has  endeared  him  to  me  a  thoufand  times.
Go,  Sir,  fearch  him  out ;  bring  him  from  his
retreat,  and  tell  him,  that  Horatia  Horton
knows  no  value  in  wealth,  but  in  the  plea-
fure  of  dividing  it  with  him.</p>
<p>Sir  Simon .  Eluzza,  huzza !  here‚Äôs  a  woman
for  ye  !  Madam,  he  is  not  poor.  I‚Äôll  put  down
for  Afgill  thoufand  for  thoufand,  as  long  as
you  pleafe,  and  when  I  die,  leave  him  a  plumb  !</p>

tered  ;  but  noble  fentiments  are  uttered  by
fcoundrels,  who  do  not  poffefs  one  feeling,

<p>fcoundrel  had  like  to  have  undone  us  {ftps&rsquo;).
He  is  a  great  fool,  but  he  is  related  to  all  the  ap
Morgans,  and  ap  Shonefes  in  the  county.‚Äô ‚Äô
Ha,  ha,  ha  !  That  was  well,  I  never  hook‚Äôd

<p>Georgina  rujhes  in.</p>
<p>It  is,  it  is  herfelf !  My  charming  Savoyard,
how  I  rejoice  to  fee  you  !  You  are  my  mother,

<p>Fancourt  ( going  up  to  Mrs.  Fan  court). .  You,
Madam,  to  whofe  officioufnefs  my  friend  and
I,  owe  our  difgrace ‚Äî you  fhall  be  rewarded.
Now  lifben  ( feizing  her  hand ),  for  I  am  going</p>
<p>to  plunge  a  dagger  into  your  heart - you  are</p>
<p>not  my  wife.  ( flinging  away  her  hand.)</p>
<p>Mrs.  Fancourt.  Not  your  wife?</p>
<p>Fancourt .  No.  Your  affedlation  and  delicacy
would  not  permit  you  to  be  married  in  a
Church ,  you  may  remember,  fo  I  took  advan¬¨
tage  of  your  folly,  and  brought  a  man,  who
was  never  prieft  till  that  moment.</p>
<p>Fippy.  It  is  very  true,  and  I  am  he ;  it  was
I  who  married  you.  ( bowing  low)</p>
<p>Mrs.  Fancourt .  Can  it  be  pofiible  ?  Do  I
hear  right  ?  Am  I&rsquo;  releas‚Äôd  from  obedience  to
a  man  whom  I  abhor  ?  Is  it  no  longer  my  duty
to  affociate  with  vice  ?  Is  it  no  longer  my  fate
to  eat  the  bread  of  wickednefs  ?  O,  blifsful
moment !</p>
<p>Fippy.  I  am  furprifed  you  feel  fo  ;  he  is  a
very  good  kind  of  young  man.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Fancourt.  O !  welcome  poverty  and
want !</p>
<p>Georgina.  Never!  Your  fate  is  united  to
i  mine.</p>
<p>A  COMEDY.</p>

muft  quit  you  a  few  moments,  for  Lady  Ho-
ratia  Horton  has  fent  Mr.  Conway  for  me  $  but
I  will  leave  you  in  my  own  apartment.  My

<p>Sir  Robert.  Yes,  that  fhe  fliall,  if  my  pro¬¨

<p>Mrs .  Fancourt .  Unhappy  man,  farewell  1  The

O  !  whilft  innocence  and  friendfhip  invite  me

<p>[Georgina  leads  her  out .</p>
<p>Sir  Robert .  And  now,  gentlemen,  leave  my
houfe  this  moment,  or  the  next  you  fhall  be
returned  into  the  hands  of  the  conftables.  Go  !
turn  out  upon  the  world  !</p>
<p>Fancourt .  We  will  turn  out  upon  the  world;
fo  let  the  world  beware  !  Come,  Tippy,  the
held  before  us  is  a  wide  one - -let  us  ereCt  our</p>

which  we  encounter  Vanity  and  FolU.  When¬¨
ever  they  appear,  we  wage  war.  Allons  !  (to
Fippy.)  Be  of  good  heart,  my  boy  !  The  foe
is  numerous,  but  weak.  Conqueft  and  pillage
are  our  own  !  [Fhey  go  off.</p>
<p>Sir  Robert  (looking  after  them).  I  am  glad  you
are  off!  Thefe  gentlemen  have  given  me  fome

<p>Lady  Horatia  enters ,  accompanied  by  Lady</p>
<p>Charlotte.</p>
<p>Lady  Horatia.  No ‚Äî no ‚Äî Adieu  to  low  Iplrits
for  ever !  My  heart  is  as  light  as  the  feather  in
your  hair ;  I  know  all ;  Mr.  Conway  has  told
me  every  thing ;  there  was  no  plot  on  me !  No,
my  Afgill  has  proved  himfelf  in  the  hour  of
trial,  as  noble,  as  delicate,  as  brave  as  my
fancy  had  always  painted  him.</p>
<p>Lady  Charlotte.  Well,  happinefs  is  a  mod  be¬¨
coming  thing ;  it  gives  fire  and  expreffion  to
every  feature.  But  can  it  be  poffible  that  Mr.
Afgill  fhould  defign  to  ferve  as  a  failor  ?  I
thought  the  party  with  whom  he ‚Äî *‚Äî</p>
<p>Lady  Horatia.  Mention  parties  at  an  hour
like  this !  O  !  let  fueh  diftin&amp;ions  melt  into
air,  and  be  obliterated  for  ever !  Let  every
party  join  hand  and  heart  to  fave  this  country,
and  to  cherilli  its  blessed  constitution  !</p>
<p>Lady  Charlotte.  See,  here  comes  Georgina,
playing  the  little  tyrant  with  her  enamour&rsquo;d
Conwy.</p>
<p>Enter  Conway  leading  Georgina.</p>
<p>Georgina .  I  protefi:  I  will  not  hear  fuch
things,  Mr.  Conway.  ( fnatches  away  her  hand)
Why  will  you  teaze  me  thus  P  Lady  Horatia,
I  beg  you  chide  him  ;  for  he  has  been  talking
nonfenfe  to  me  all  the  way  in  vour  coach.</p>
<p>Lady  Horatia.  It  will  give  him  more  plea¬¨
sure  if  you  chide  him.  Nay,  I  will  be  more</p>
<p>A  COMEDY.  I0I</p>
<p>malicious  ftill,  fpitc  of  your  frowns ;  I  abso¬¨
lutely  will  tell  you -</p>

<p>Georgina  puts  her  hand  to  Lady  Horatio&rsquo;s  mouth.
You  do  not  hate  him.</p>
<p>Conway.  O  !  that  found  is  biifs  to  me  !</p>
<p>Georgina.  Ah,  but  I  am  fure  I  do  not  love
him.  ,</p>
<p>Conway .  How  do  you  know,  angel  ?</p>
<p>Georgina .  W hy,  I  never  keep  wakeful  about</p>
<p>I  you,  nor  ever  dream  about  you.  And  1
do  not  grow  pale,  like  Mifs  Gwatkin ;  and
I  eat  my  breakfeft  with  pleafure,  and  I  dine
very  well;  and  if  I  do  not  fee  yoti  for  a
whole  day  together,  I  only  think - well,  to¬¨</p>
<p>morrow  I  Hi  all  be  more  lucky.</p>
<p>Conway  (in  rapture ).  Enough,  enough- _ -</p>
<p>|  more  than  I  hoped.  On  thefe  terms  I  am  con-
|  cent  to  bind  my  fate  to  yours.  Such  artlefs
|  candour  renders  you  enchanting.</p>
<p>R  Gcoi gina.  Well,  then&ndash;*  but  do  not  fpeak  to

I  Conway.)</p>
<p>Enter  Sir  Simon,  with  Asgill,  in  a  jailor&rsquo;s  drejs,</p>
<p>||  Sit  Simon.  Here,  Madam,  I  have  brought
j  ye  your  Tailor;  and  if  you  do  not  receive  him
with  kindnels,  and  welcome  him  back  with  your
whole  foul,  you  are  no  woman  for  me  !</p>
<p>AJglll  (rujhing  to  her  feet).  Adored  miftrefs
of  my  heart  !  am  I  welcome  ?</p>
<p>Lady  Horatia.  Welcome  !  O,  Algill,  there
are .  characters  fo  high,  fo  noble,  that  to  be
chained  in  by  common  decorums,  would  be  to
have  no  tafte  for  excellence,  and  my  heart</p>
<p>hounds</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>THE  tOWN  BEFORE  YOU,</p>
<p>bounds  with  difdain  from  fuch  frozen  rules  !  I,
who  have  hitherto  treated  you  with  coldnefs,
almofl:  bordering  on  difdain,  now  declare,  in
the  prefence  of  my  friends,  that  I  am  proud
to  make  you  mailer  of  my  fate ;  that  I  feel
exalted  in  having  it  in  my  power  to  confer
happinefs  on  you.</p>
<p>Afgill  (fifing).  O  !  woman  unequall‚Äôd  ! -</p>
<p>Bleifed  be  the  hour  in  which  you  believed  me
poor  and  undone  !  Sir  Simon  has  been  feeding
my  foul  with  exftacy.</p>
<p>Lady  Horatia .  Mr.  Afgill,  you  mull,  indeed,
love  Sir  Simon  ;  but  I  know  not  how  I  fhall
fet  about  doing  fo  ;  he  hates  the  arts ;  he  thinks
there  is  nothing  dignified  in  fculpture  ;  he  hears,
without  veneration,  the  names  of  Phidias,  and
Michael  Angelo.</p>
<p>Sir  Simon .  Come,  come,  Madam,  throw
away  your  chifel  and  your  marble  blocks,  and
fet  about  making  a  good  wife.  That  ART  is
the  nobleft  pride  of  an  Englifhwoman.</p>
<p>Lady  Charlotte.  Lady  Horatia,  you  are  all
fmiles !  I  declare  I  Ihould  not  fo  eafily  have
forgiven  a  man  ( looking  on  Afgill)  who  could
fly  from  me  to  the  boilterous  ocean,  and  prove
fuch  infenfibility  to  beauty  and  love.</p>
<p>Afgill .  Misjudge  me  not !  I,  infenfible  to
beauty,  and  to  love  !  O !  my  glowing  foul
confefifes  their  force,  and  adores  their  power.
Yet  the  enthufiafm  which  feized  me,  when  I
trod  the  deck  of  the  Viftory,  can  never  be
chill‚Äôd  !  In  the  glorious  tars  around  me,  va¬¨
lour,  intrepidity,  heroifm,  fhone  forth  with  all
their  fires ;  they  flafhed  through  my  heart  !
And,  I  fwear,  that  fhould  my  country  need  my
alliltance,  I  will  again  relume  the  trowfers,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>A  COMEDY.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>and  fail  before  the  mail,  wherever  lhe  bids  her
cannon  roar,  or  her  proud  pendants  fly.</p>
<p>( Advancing  forward)</p>
<p>Ah  !  repofe  on  us !  And  when  you  look  on  the
gallant  ipirits,  who  do  honour  to  this  habit,
let  every  fear  fubfide ;  for,  whilft  the  fea
flows,  and  Englifh  failors  are  themf elves,  Eng¬¨
