    <p>Rain Magic By Erle Stanley Gardner</p>
<p>Novelette&ndash;Complete</p>
<p>FACT OR FICTION</p>
<p>RAIN MAGIC is a most unusual
story; it is one of those tales that
leave something in the reader&rsquo;s mind to
think about-something on which his opin-
ion is as good as any one else&rsquo;s&ndash;as good
as that of the author himself.
From the middle of the California desert
it came to us&ndash;a story of the far places of
tropical Africa. The postmark interested
us; the opening scene on the desert in-
trigued us; the indefinable feeling of re-
ality which cloaks the weird and unusual
incidents fascinated us. So much so that
we wrote to the author requesting that he
tell us something of the history of the
story.
Mr. Gardner&rsquo;s most remarkable letter is
printed in full in Argonotes. Read the
story, then turn to the author&rsquo;s strange ac-
count of its origin. Then, perhaps, you,
too, will close the magazine and sit back
with Mr. Gardner and with us-and won-
der. Wonder how much of it is fact and
how much fiction&ndash;wonder how much truth
lies behind an adventure so incredible.

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>
<p>THROUGH THE BREAKERS.</p>
<p>No,no-.no more coffee. Thanks.
Been asleep, eh? Well, don&rsquo;t
look so worried about it. Mighty
nice of you to wake me up. What day
is it?
Thursday, eh? I&rsquo;ve been asleep two
days then-oh, it is? Then it&rsquo;s been
nine days. That&rsquo;s more like it.
It was the rain, you see. I tried to
get back to my tent, but the storm came
up too fast. It&rsquo;s the smell of the damp
green things in a rain. The doctors tell
me it&rsquo;s auto-hypnosis. They&rsquo;re wrong.
M&rsquo;Gamba told me I&rsquo;d always be that
way when I smelled the jungle smell.
It&rsquo;s the sleeping sickness in my veins.
That&rsquo;s why I came to the desert. It
doesn&rsquo;t rain out here more than once
or twice a year.
When it does rain the jungle smells
come back and the sleeping sickness gets
me. Funny how my memory comes
back after those long sleeps. It was
the drugged bread, king-kee they called
it; but the language ain&rsquo;t never been
written down. Sort of a graduated
monkey talk it was.
It&rsquo;s hot here, come over in the shad-
ow of this Joshuay palm. That&rsquo;s better.
Ever been to sea? No? Then you
won&rsquo;t understand.
IT was down off the coast of Africa
Anything can happen off the coast
of Africa. After the storms, the
Sahara dust comes and paints the rig-
ging white. Yes, sir, three hundred
miles out to sea I&rsquo;ve seen it. And for
a hundred miles you can get the smell
of the jungles. When the wind&rsquo;s right.
It was an awful gale. You don&rsquo;t see
&rsquo;em like it very often. We tried to let
go the deckload of lumber, but the
chains jammed. The Dutchmen took
to the riggin&rsquo; jabberin&rsquo; prayers. They
were a weak-kneed lot. It was the
Irishman that stayed with it. He was
a cursin&rsquo; devil.
He got busy with an ax. The load
had listed and we was heeled over to
port. The Dutchmen in the riggin&rsquo;
prayin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; the Irishman down on the
lumber cursin&rsquo;. A wave took him over
and then another wave washed him
back again. I seen it with my own
eyes. He didn&rsquo;t give up. He just
cursed harder than ever.  And he got
the chains loose, too. The deck load
slid off and she righted.
But it was heavy weather and it got
worse. The sky was just a mass of
whirlin&rsquo; wind and the water came over
until she didn&rsquo;t get rid of one wave be-
fore the next bunch of green water was
On top of her.
The rudder carried away. I thought
everything was gone, but she lived
through it. We got blown in, almost
on top of the shore. When the gale
died we could see it. There was a spe-
cies of palm stickin&rsquo; up against the sky,
tall trees they were, and below &rsquo;em was
a solid mass of green stuff, and it stunk.
The whole thing was decayin&rsquo; an
steamin&rsquo; just like the inside of a rotten,
damp log.
The old man was a bad one. It was
a hell ship an&rsquo; no mistake. I&rsquo;d been
shanghaied, an&rsquo; I wanted back. Thirty
pound I had in my pocket when I felt
the drink rockin&rsquo; my head. I knew then,
but it was too late. The last I remem-
bered was the grinnin&rsquo; face of the tout
smilin&rsquo; at me through a blue haze.
The grub was rotten. The old man
was a devil when he was sober, an&rsquo;
worse when he was drunk. The Irish
mate cursed all the time, cursed and
worked. Between &rsquo;em they drove the
men, drove us like sheep.
The moon was half full. After the
storm the waves were rollin&rsquo; in on a
good sea breeze. There wasn&rsquo;t any
whitecaps. The wind just piled the
water up until the breakers stood four-
teen feet high before they curled an&rsquo;
raced up the beach.
But the breakers didn&rsquo;t look so bad
from the deck of the ship. Not in the
light of the half moon they didn&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;d
been at work on the rudder an&rsquo; there
was a raft over the side. I was on
watch, an&rsquo; the old man was drunk, aw-
ful drunk. I don&rsquo;t know when the idea
came to me, but it seemed to have al-
ways been there. It just popped out
in front when it got a chance.
I was halfway down the rope before
I really knew what I was doin&rsquo;. My
bare feet hit the raft an&rsquo; my sailor knife
was workin&rsquo; on the rope before I had a
chance to even think things over.
But I had a chance on the road in,
riding the breakers. I had a chance
even as soon as the rope was cut. The
old man came and stood on the rail,
lookin&rsquo; at the weather, too drunk to
know what he was looking at, but cock-
in&rsquo; his bleary eye at the sky outa habit.
He&rsquo;d have seen me, drunk as he was,
if he&rsquo;d looked down, but he didn&rsquo;t. If
he&rsquo;d caught me then I&rsquo;d have been
flayed alive. He&rsquo;d have sobered up just
special for the occasion.
I drifted away from him. The moon
was on the other side of the hull, leav-
in&rsquo; it just a big, black blotch o&rsquo; shadow,
ripplin&rsquo; on the water, heavin&rsquo; up into
the sky. Then I drifted out of the
shadow and into golden water. The
moon showed over the top of the boat.
an&rsquo; the sharks got busy.
I&rsquo;d heard they never struck at a man
while he was strugglin&rsquo;. Maybe it&rsquo;s
true. I kept movin&rsquo;, hands and feet
goin&rsquo;. The raft was only an inch or
two outa water, an&rsquo; it was narrow. The
sharks cut through the water like hiss-
in&rsquo; shadows. I was afraid one of &rsquo;em
would grab a hand or a foot an&rsquo; drag
me down, but they didn&rsquo;t. I could keep
the rest of me outa the water, but not
my hands an&rsquo; feet. I had to paddle
with &rsquo;em to get into shore before the
wind and tide changed. I didn&rsquo;t want
to be left floatin&rsquo; around there with no
sail, nor food; nothin&rsquo; but sharks.
From the ship the breakers looked
easy an&rsquo; lazylike. When I got in closer
I saw they were monsters. They&rsquo;d rise
up an&rsquo; blot out all the Iand, even the
tops of the high trees. Just before
they&rsquo;d break they&rsquo;d send streamers of
spray, high up in the heavens. Then
they&rsquo;d come down with a crash.
But I couldn&rsquo;t turn back. The sharks
and the wind and the tide were all
against me, and the old man would have
killed me.
I rode in on a couple of breakers,
and then the third one broke behind
me. The raft an&rsquo; .me, an&rsquo; maybe the
sharks all got mixed up together. My
feet struck the sand, but they wouldn&rsquo;t
stay there.
The strong undertow was cuttin&rsquo;
the sand out from under me. I could
feel it racin&rsquo; along over my toes, an&rsquo;
then I started back an&rsquo; down.
The undertow sucked me under an-
other wave, somethin&rsquo; alive brushed
against my back, an&rsquo; then tons o&rsquo; water
came down over me. That time I was
on the bottom an&rsquo; I rolled along with
sand an&rsquo; water bein&rsquo; pumped into my
innards. I thought it was the end, but
there was a lull in the big ones, an&rsquo; a
couple o&rsquo; little ones came an&rsquo; rolled me
up on the beach.
I WAS more dead than alive.The
water had made me groggy, an&rsquo; I
was sore from the pummelin&rsquo; I&rsquo;d got.
I staggered up the strip of sand an&rsquo; into
the jungle.
A little ways back was a cave, an&rsquo; in-
to the cave I flopped. The water oozed
out of my insides like from a soaked
sponge. My lungs an&rsquo; stomach an&rsquo; ears
were all full. I tried to get over a log
an&rsquo; let &rsquo;er drain out, but I was too weak.
I felt everything turnin&rsquo; black to me.
The next thing I knew it was gettin
dawn an&rsquo; shadowy shapes were flittin&rsquo;
around. I thought they was black an-
gels an&rsquo; they were goin&rsquo; to smother me.
They stunk with a musty smell, an&rsquo; they
settled all over me.
Then I could feel the blood runnin&rsquo;
over my skin. It got a little lighter, an&rsquo;
I could see. I was in a bat cave an
the bats were comin&rsquo; back.They&rsquo;d
found me an&rsquo; were settlin&rsquo; on me in
clouds, suckin&rsquo; blood.
I tried to fight &rsquo;em off, but it was like
fightin&rsquo; a fog. Sometimes I&rsquo;d hit &rsquo;em,
but they&rsquo;d just sail through the air, an
I couldn&rsquo;t hurt &rsquo;em. All the time, they
was flutterin&rsquo; their wings an&rsquo; lookin&rsquo;
for a chance to get more blood.
I&rsquo;d got the weight of &rsquo;em off, though,
an&rsquo; I staggered out of the cave. They
followed me for a ways; but when I
got out to where it was gettin&rsquo; light
they went back in the cave. It gets light
quick down there in the tropics, an&rsquo; the
light hurt their eyes.
I rolled into the sand an&rsquo; went to
sleep.
When I woke up I heard marchin&rsquo;
feet. It sounded like an army. They
was comin&rsquo; regular like, slow, unhur-
ried, deliberate. It made the chills
come up my spine just to hear the
boom, boom, boom of those feet.
I crawled deeper into the sand under
the shadows of the overhangin&rsquo; green
stuff. Naked men an&rsquo; women filed out
onto the beach.
I watched &rsquo;em.
Chocolate-colored they were, an&rsquo;
they talked a funny, squeaky talk. I
found afterward some&rsquo;of the words
was Fanti and some was a graduated
monkey talk. Fanti ain&rsquo;t never been
written down.
It&rsquo;s one of the Tshi languages. The
Ashantis an&rsquo; the Fantis an&rsquo; one or two
other tribes speak branches o&rsquo; the same
lingo. But these people spoke part
Fanti an&rsquo; part graduated monkey talk.
An&rsquo; among &rsquo;em was a monkey-man.
He was a funny guy. There was coarse
hair all over him, an&rsquo; he had a stub of
a tail. His big toes weren&rsquo;t set like
mine, but they was twisted like a foot
thumb.
No, I didn&rsquo;t notice the toes at the
time. I found that out later, while he
was sittin&rsquo; on a limb gettin&rsquo; ready to
shoot a poisoned arrow at me. I
thought every minute was my last, an&rsquo;
then was when I noticed the way his
foot thumbs wrapped around the limb.
Funny how a man will notice little
things when he&rsquo;s near death.
Anyway, this tribe came down an&rsquo;
marched into the water, men, women,
an&rsquo; children. They washed themselves
up to the hips, sort of formal, like it
was a ceremony. The rest of them they
didn&rsquo;t get water on at all. They came
out an&rsquo; rubbed sort of an oil on their
arms, chests, an&rsquo; faces.</p>
<p>CHAPTER II.
LIFE OR DEATH.</p>
<p>FINALLY they. all went away, all
except a woman an&rsquo; a little kid.
The woman was lookin&rsquo; for some-
thin&rsquo; in the water-fish, maybe. The
kid was on a rock about eight feet
away, a little shaver he was, an&rsquo; he had
a funny pot-belly. I looked at him an&rsquo;
I looked at her.
I was sick an&rsquo; I was hungry, an&rsquo; I
was bleedin&rsquo; from the bats. The smell
of the jungle was in my lungs, so I
couldn&rsquo;t tell whether the air was full of
jungle or whether I was breathin&rsquo; in
jungle stuff with just a little air. It&rsquo;s
a queer sensation. Unless you&rsquo;ve been
through it you wouldn&rsquo;t understand.
Well, I felt it was everything or
nothin&rsquo;. The woman couldn&rsquo;t kill me,
an&rsquo; the kid couldn&rsquo;t. An&rsquo; I had to make
myself known an&rsquo; get somethin&rsquo; to eat.
I straightened out of the sand.
&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; said I.
The kid was squattin&rsquo; on his
haunches. He didn&rsquo;t seem to jump. He
just flew through the air an&rsquo; he sailed
right onto his mother&rsquo;s back. His
hands clung to her shoulders an&rsquo; his
head pressed tight against her skin, the
eyes rollin&rsquo; at me, but the head never
movin&rsquo;.
The mother made three jumps right
up the sand, an&rsquo; then she sailed into
the air an&rsquo; caught the branch of a tree.
The green stuff was so thick that I lost
sight of &rsquo;em both right there. I could
hear a lot of jabberin&rsquo; monkey talk
in the trees, an&rsquo; then I heard the
squeaky voice of the woman talkin&rsquo;
back to the monkeys. I could tell the
way she was goin&rsquo; by the jabber of
monkey talk.
No, I can&rsquo;t remember words of mon-
key talk. I never got so I could talk
to the monkeys. But the people did. I
am goin&rsquo; to tell you about that. I&rsquo;m
explainin&rsquo; about the sleepin&rsquo; sickness
an&rsquo; about how the memories come back
to me after I&rsquo;ve been asleep.
Maybe they&rsquo;re dreams, but maybe
they ain&rsquo;t. If they&rsquo;re dreams, how
comes it that when I got to Cape Coast
Castle I couldn&rsquo;t remember where I&rsquo;d
been? They brought me in there on
stretchers, an&rsquo; nobody knows how far
they&rsquo;d brought me. They left me in
the dead o&rsquo; night. But the next morn-
in&rsquo; there were the tracks, an&rsquo; they were
tracks like nobody there had ever seen
before.
There&rsquo;s strange things in Africa,
an&rsquo; this was when I was a young blood,
remember that. I was an upstandin&rsquo;
youngster, too. I&rsquo;d tackle anything,
even the west coast of Africa on a raft,
an&rsquo; the Fanti warriors; but I&rsquo;m comin&rsquo;
to that directly.
Well, the woman ran away, an&rsquo; the
monkeys came. They stuck around on
the trees an&rsquo; jabbered monkey talk at
me. I wished I&rsquo;d been like the woman
an&rsquo; could have talked to &rsquo;em. But the
monkeys ain&rsquo;t got so many words.
There&rsquo;s a lot of it that&rsquo;s just tone stuff.
It was the ants that could speak, but
they rubbed feelers together.
Oh, yes, there was ants, great, wool-
ly ants two inches long, ants that built
houses out of sticks. They built &rsquo;em
thirty feet high, an&rsquo; some of the sticks
was half an inch round an&rsquo; six or eight
inches long. They had the ants guard-
in&rsquo; the gold ledge, an&rsquo; nobody except
Kk-Kk, the feeder, an&rsquo; the goldsmith
could come near there.
The goldsmith was nothin&rsquo; but a
slave, anyway. They&rsquo;d captured him
from a slaver that went ashore. The
others died of the fever, but the na-
tives gave the goldsmith some medi-
cine that cured him. After that he
couldn&rsquo;t get sick. They could have
done the same by me, too, but the
monkey-man was my enemy. He want-
ed Kk-Kk for himself.
Finally I heard the tramp of feet
again, an&rsquo; the warriors of the tribe
came out. They had spears an&rsquo; little
bows with long arrows. The arrows
were as thin as a pencil. They didn&rsquo;t
look like they&rsquo;d hurt anything, but
there was a funny color on the points,
a sort of shimmering something.
I found out afterward that was
where they&rsquo;d coated &rsquo;em with poison
an&rsquo; baked the poison into the wood.
One scratch with an arrow like that an&rsquo;
a man or a beast would die. But it
didn&rsquo;t hurt the flesh none for eatin&rsquo;.
Either of man or beast it didn&rsquo;t. They
ate &rsquo;em both.
I SAW it was up to me to make a
speech. The men all looked serious
an&rsquo; dignified. That is, they all did
except the monkey-man. He capered
around on the outside. His balance
didn&rsquo;t seem good on his two feet, so
he&rsquo;d stoop over an&rsquo; use the backs&rsquo;of
his knuckles to steady himself. He
could hitch along over the ground like
the wind. His arms were long, long
an&rsquo; hairy, an&rsquo; the inside of his palms
was all wrinkled, thick an&rsquo; black.
Anyhow, I made a speech.
I told &rsquo;em that I was awful tough,
an&rsquo; that I was thin, an&rsquo; maybe the bat
bites had poisoned me, so I wouldn&rsquo;t
advise &rsquo;em to cook me. I told &rsquo;em I was
a friend an&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t come to bother
&rsquo;em, but to get away from the big ship
that was layin&rsquo; offshore.
I thought they understood me, be-
cause some of &rsquo;em was lookin&rsquo; at the
ship. But I found out afterward they
didn&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;d seen the ship, an&rsquo; they&rsquo;d
seen me, an&rsquo; they saw the dried salt
water on my clothes, an&rsquo; they figgered
it out for themselves.
I finished with my speech. I didn&rsquo;t
expect &rsquo;em to clap their hands, because
they had spears an&rsquo; bows, but I thought
maybe they&rsquo;d smile. They was a funny
bunch, all gathered around there in a
circle, grave an&rsquo; naked like. An&rsquo; they.
all had three scars on each side of their
cheek bones. It made &rsquo;em look tough.
Then the monkey-man gave a sort of.
a leap an&rsquo; lit in the trees, an&rsquo; the mon-
keys came around and jabbered, an&rsquo; he
jabbered, an&rsquo; somehow I thought he
was tellin&rsquo; the monkeys about me.
Maybe he was. I never got to know
the monkey talk.
An&rsquo; then from the jungle behind me
I heard a girl&rsquo;s voice, an&rsquo; it was speak-
in&rsquo; good English.
&ldquo;Be silent and I shall speak to my
father,&rdquo; she said.
You can imagine how I felt hearin&rsquo;
an English voice from the jungle that
way, an&rsquo; knowin&rsquo; it was a girl&rsquo;s voice.
But I knew she wasn&rsquo;t a white woman.
I could tell that by the sound of the
voice, sort of the way the tongue didn&rsquo;t
click against the roof.of the mouth, but
the lips made the speech soft like.
An&rsquo; then there was a lot of squeaky
talk from the jungles back of me.
There was silence after that talk, an&rsquo;
then I heard the girl&rsquo;s voice. again.
&quot; They&rsquo;ve gone for the goldsmith.
He&rsquo;ll talk to you.&quot;
I didn&rsquo;t see who had gone, an&rsquo; I
didn&rsquo;t know who the goldsmith was. I
turned around an&rsquo; tried to see into the
jungle, but all I could see was leaves,
trunks an&rsquo; vine stems.. There was a
wispy blue vapor that settled all around
an&rsquo;&lsquo;overhead the air was white way
way up, white with Sahara dust. But
down low the jungle odor hung around
the ground. Around me the circle stood
naked an&rsquo; silent. Not a man moved.
Who was the goldsmith?&ndash;I won-
dered. Who was the girl?
Then I heard steps behind me an&rsquo; the
jungle parted. I smelled somethin&rsquo;
burnin&rsquo;. It wasn&rsquo;t tobacco, not the
kind we have, but it was a sort of a
tobacco flavor.
A man came out into the circle.
smokin&rsquo; a pipe.
&quot; How are yuh?&quot; he says, an&rsquo; sticks
forward a hand.
HE was a white man, part white
anyway, an&rsquo; he had on some fun-
ny clothes. They were made of
skins, but they were cut like a tailor
would cut &rsquo;em. He even had a skin
hat with a stiff brim. He&rsquo;d made the
stiff brim out of green skin with the
hair rubbed off.
He was smokin&rsquo; a clay pipe, an&rsquo; there
was a vacant look in his eyes, a blank
somethin&rsquo; like a man who didn&rsquo;t have
feelin&rsquo;s any more, but was just a man-
machine.
I shook hands with him.
&quot; Are they goin&rsquo; to eat me?&quot; I asks.
He&rsquo; smoked awhile before he spoke.
an&rsquo; then he takes the pipe out of his
mouth an&rsquo; nods his head.
&quot; Sure,&quot; he says.
It wasn&rsquo;t encouragin&rsquo;.
&ldquo;Have hope,&rdquo; came the voice from
the jungle, the voice of the girl. She
seemed to be standin&rsquo; close, close an&rsquo;
keepin&rsquo; in one place, but I couldn&rsquo;t see
her.
I talked to the man with the pipe. I
made him a speech. He turned around
and talked to the circle of men, an&rsquo; they
didn&rsquo;t say anything.
Finally an old man grunted, an&rsquo; like
the grunt was an order they all squat-
ted down on their haunches, all of &rsquo;em
facin&rsquo; me.
Then the girl in the jungle made
squeaky noises. The old man seemed
to be listenin&rsquo; to her. The others didn&rsquo;t
listen to anything. They were just star-
in&rsquo; at me, an&rsquo; the expression on all of
the faces was the same. It was sort
of a curiosity, but it wasn&rsquo;t a curiosity
to see what I looked like. I felt it was
a curiosity to see what I&rsquo;d taste like.
Then the goldsmith rubbed some
more brown leaf into the pipe, right on
top of the coals of the other pipeful.
&ldquo;The girl is claimin&rsquo; you as a slave,&rdquo;
he says.
&quot; Who is the girl?&quot; I asked him.
&quot; Kk-Kk,&quot; he says, an&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t know
whether he was givin&rsquo; me a name or
warnin&rsquo; me to keep quiet.
Well, I figured I&rsquo;d rather be a slave
than a meal, so I kept quiet.
Then the monkey man in the tree
began to jabber.
They didn&rsquo;t look up at him, but I
could see they were listenin&rsquo;. When he
got done the girl squeaked some more
words.
Then the monkey-man made some
more talk, and the girl talked. The
fellow with the pipe smoked an&rsquo; blew
the smoke out of his nose. His eyes
were weary an&rsquo; puckered.He was an
odd fellow.
Finally the old man that had grunt-
ed an&rsquo; made &rsquo;em squat, gave another
grunt. They all stood up.
This is the show-down, I says to my-
self. It&rsquo;s either bein&rsquo; a white slave or
bein&rsquo; a meat loaf.
The old man looked at me an&rsquo;
blinked. Then he sucked his lips into
his mouth until his face was all puck-
ered into wrinkles.He blinked his lid-
less eyes some more an&rsquo; then grunted
twice. Then all the men marched off.
I could hear their feet boomin&rsquo; along
the hard ground in the jungle,on a path
that had been beaten down hard by mil-
lions of bare feet. I found out after-
ward that same path had been used for
over a hundred years,an&rsquo;the king made
a law it had to be traveled every day.
That was the only way they could keep
the ground hard.
I guess I&rsquo;m a meal, I thought to my-
self.- I figgered the goldsmith would
have told me if I had been goin&rsquo;to be
a slave. But he&rsquo;d moved off with the
rest, an&rsquo; he hadn&rsquo;t said a word.
THE monkey-man kept talkin&rsquo;to
the bunch. He didn&rsquo;t walk along
the path, but he moved through
the trees, keepin&rsquo; up in the branches,
right over the heads of the others, an&rsquo;
talkin&rsquo; all the time, an&rsquo; his words didn&rsquo;t
seem happy words.  I sort of felt he
was scoldin&rsquo; like a monkey that&rsquo;s watch-
in&rsquo; yuh eat a coconut.
But the old man grunted at him, an&rsquo;
he shut up like a clam. He was mad,
though.I could tell that because he
set off through the trees, tearin&rsquo; after
a couple of monkeys. An he pretty
nearly caught &rsquo;em.They sounded like
a whirlwind, tearin&rsquo; through the
branches. Then the sounds got faint-
er, an&rsquo; finally everything was still.
I looked around. There was nobody
in sight. I was there, on the fringe of
beach,right near the edge of the jungle,
and everything was still an&rsquo; silent.
Then there came a rustlin&rsquo; of the jun-
gle stuff an&rsquo; she came out.
She had on a skirt of grass stuff, an&rsquo;
her eyes were funny. You know how
a monkey&rsquo;s eyes are? They&rsquo;re round.
They don&rsquo;t squint up any at the cor-
ners.. An&rsquo; they&rsquo;re sort of moist an&rsquo; glis-
tening on the surface. It&rsquo;s a kind of
a liquid expression.
Her eyes were like that.
For the rest she was like the others.
Her skin was dusky,but not black, an&rsquo;
it was smooth. It was like a piece of
chocolate silk.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Kk-Kk the daughter of Yik-
Yik, and the keeper of the gold ledge,&rdquo;
she said.&quot; I have learned to speak the
language of the goldsmith. You, too,
speak the same language. You are my
slave.&quot;
&quot; Thank God I ain&rsquo;t a meal&quot; I said.
That was before the doctor guys dis-
covered these here calories in food;but
right then I didn&rsquo;t feel like a half a
good-sized calory, much less a fit meal
for a native warrior
&ldquo;You will be my slave,&rdquo; she said,
&quot; but if you pay skins to my father you
can buy your freedom, and then you
will be a warrior.&quot;
&quot; I ain&rsquo;t never been a slave to a wom-
an,&quot; I told her, me bein&rsquo;one of the kind
that had always kept from being led
to the altar,&ldquo;but I&rsquo;d rather be a slave
to you than to that old man on the boat
out yonder.&rdquo;
There was something half shy about
her, and yet something proud and dig-
nified.
&ldquo;I have promised my father my
share of the next hunt in order to pur-
chase you from the tribe,&rdquo; she went on.
&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; I told her, knowin&rsquo; it was
up to me to say somethin&rsquo;, but sort of
wonderin&rsquo; whether a free, white man
should thank a woman who had made a
slave outa him.
&quot; Come,&quot; she said, an&rsquo; turned away.
I had more of a chance to study her
back. She was lithe, graceful, and she
was a well-turned lass. There was a
set to her head, a funny little twist of
her shoulders when she walked that
showed she was royalty and knowed it.
Funny how people get that little touch
of class no matter where they are or
what stock. Just as soon as they get
royal blood in &rsquo;em they get it. I&rsquo;ve seen
&rsquo;em everywhere.
I followed her into the jungle, down
under the branches where there wasn&rsquo;t
sunlight any more ; but the day was just
filled with green light.
Finally we came through the jungle
an&rsquo; into a big clearin&rsquo;. There were
huts around the clearin&rsquo; an&rsquo; a big fire.
The people of the tribe were here, goin.
about their business in knots of two an&rsquo;
three just like nothin&rsquo; had happened.
I was a member of the tribe now, the
slave of Kk-Kk.
Most of the women stared, an&rsquo; the
kids scampered away when they seen
me look toward &rsquo;em; but that was all.
The men took me for granted.</p>
<p>CHAPTER III.
GUARDIANS OF GOLD.</p>
<p>THE girl took me to a hut.In one
corner was a frame of wood with
animal skins stretched over it.
There were all kinds of skins. Some
of &rsquo;em I knew, more of &rsquo;em I didn&rsquo;t.
She squeaked out some words, an
then there was some more jabberin&rsquo; in
a quaverin&rsquo; voice, an&rsquo; an old woman
came an&rsquo; brought me fruits.
I squatted down on my heels the way
the natives did, an&rsquo; tried to eat the fruit.
My stomach was still pretty full of salt
water an&rsquo; sand, but the fruit tasted
good. Then they gave me a half a
coconut shell filled with some sort of
creamy liquid that had bubbles comin&rsquo;
up in it. It tasted sort of sour, but it
had a lot of authority. Ten minutes
after I drank it I felt my neck snap
back. It was the delayed kick, an&rsquo; it
was like the hind leg of a mule.
&quot; Come,&quot; says the jane, an&rsquo; led the
way again out into the openin&rsquo;.
I followed her, across the openin&rsquo; in-
to the jungle, along a path, past the
shore of a lagoon, and up into a little
canon. Here the trees were thicker
than ever except on the walls of the
canon itself. There&rsquo;d been a few dirt
slides in that canon, an&rsquo; in one or two
places the rock had been stripped bare.
After a ways it was all rock.
An&rsquo; then we came to somethin&rsquo; that
made my eyes stick out.There was a
ledge o&rsquo;&lsquo;rock an&rsquo; a vein o&rsquo; quartz in it.
The vein was just shot with gold, an&rsquo;
in the center it was almost pure gold
The quartz was crumbly, an&rsquo; there were
pieces of it scattered around on the
ground. The foliage had been cleared
away, an&rsquo; the ground was hard. There
was a fire goin&rsquo; near the ledge an&rsquo; some
clay crucibles were there. Then there
was a great bellows affair made out of
thick, oiled leather. It was a big thing.
but all the air came out of a little piece
of hollow wood in the front.
I picked up one of the pieces of
quartz. The rock could be crumbled
between the fingers, an&rsquo; it left the gold
in my hand. The gold was just like it
showed in the rock, spreadin&rsquo; out to
form sort of a tree. There must have
been fifty dollars&rsquo; worth in the piece o&rsquo;
rock that I crumbled up in my fingers.
I moved my hands around fast an&rsquo;
managed to slip the gold in my torn
shirt. The girl was watchin&rsquo; me with
those funny, liquid eyes of hers, but she
didn&rsquo;t say a word.
There was a great big pile of small
sticks between me an&rsquo; the ledge of gold.
I figured it was kindlin&rsquo; wood that they
kept for the fire. But finally my eyes
got loose from the ledge of gold an&rsquo;
what should I see but the sticks movin&rsquo;.
I looked again, an&rsquo; then I saw some-
thin&rsquo; else.
It was a big ant heap made outa sticks
an&rsquo; sawdust. &quot; Some of those sticks were
eight or ten inches long and half an
inch around. And the whole place was
swarming with ants. They had their
heads stickin&rsquo; out of the little holes be-
tween the sticks.
They must be big ants, I thought;
but I was interested in that gold ledge.
There must have been millions of dol-
lars in it. I took a couple of steps to-
ward it, an&rsquo; then the ant heap just
swarmed with life.
They were big ants covered with sort
of a white wool and they came out of
there like somebody had given &rsquo;em an
order.
The girl shrieked somethin&rsquo; in a high-
pitched voice, but I didn&rsquo;t know wheth-
er it was at me or the ants.
The ants swarmed into two columns
of maybe eight or ten abreast in each
column, an&rsquo; they started for me, swing-
in&rsquo; out in a big circle as though one was
goin&rsquo; to come on one side, an&rsquo; one on
the other.
An&rsquo; then they stopped. The girl ran
forward an&rsquo; put her arms on my shoul-
ders an&rsquo; started caressin&rsquo; me, pattin&rsquo; my
hair, cooin&rsquo; soft noises in my ears.
I thought maybe she&rsquo;d gone cuckoo.
an&rsquo; I looked into her eyes, but they
weren&rsquo;t lookin&rsquo; at me, they were look-
in&rsquo; at the ants, an&rsquo; they were wide with
fear.
AN&rsquo; the ants were lookin&rsquo; at her.  I
could see their big eyes gazin&rsquo;
steadylike at her. Then somethin&rsquo;
else must have been said to &rsquo;em, al-
though I didn&rsquo;t hear anything. But all
at once, just like an army presentin&rsquo;
arms in response to an order, they
threw up their long feelers an&rsquo; waved
&rsquo;em gently back an&rsquo; forth. Then the
girl took me by the arm an&rsquo; moved me
away.
&ldquo;I should have told you,&rdquo; she said,
&quot; never to go past the line of that path.
The ants guard the yellow metal, and
when one comes nearer than that they
attack. There is no escape from those
ants. I took you to them so you could
help me with the feed.Now we will
feed them.&quot;
That all sounded sorta cuckoo to me,
but the whole business was cuckoo any-
way.
&quot; Look here,&quot; I tells this jane. &quot; I&rsquo;m
willin&rsquo; to be the slave of a chief&rsquo;s
daughter&ndash;for awhile. But I ain&rsquo;t
goin&rsquo; to be slave to no ant hill.&quot;
. That is not expected,&quot; she said.
&quot; It is an honor to assist in feeding
the ants, a sacred right. You only as-
sist me. Never again must you come
so near to the ants.&rsquo;
I did a lot of thinkin. I wasn&rsquo;t
hankerin&rsquo; to come into an argument
with those ants, but I was figurin&rsquo;
to take a closer slant at that gold
1edge.
She took me away into the jungle
where there was a pile of fruit dryin&rsquo;
in the sun. It was a funny sort of
fruit, an&rsquo; smelled sweet, like orange
blossoms, only there was more of a
honey smell to it.
&ldquo;Take your arms full,&rdquo; she said.
Well, it was my first experience bein&rsquo;
a slave, but I couldn&rsquo;t see as it was
much different from bein&rsquo; a sailor, only
the work was easier.
I scooped up both arms full of the
stuff.The smell made me a little dizzy
at first, but I soon got used to it. The
girl picked up some, too, an&rsquo; she led
the way back to the ant pile.
She had me put my load down an&rsquo;
showed me how to arrange it in a long
semicircle. I could see the ants watch-
in&rsquo; from out of the holes in the ant
pile, but they didn&rsquo;t do anything except
watch.
Finally the girl made a queer click-
ing sound with her tongue an&rsquo; teeth an&rsquo;
the ants commenced to boil out again.
This time they made for the fruit, an&rsquo;
they went in order, just like a bunch
of swell passengers on one of the big
ocean liners. Some of &rsquo;em seemed to
hold first meal ticket while the others
remained on guard. Then there must
have been some signal from the ants,
because the girl didn&rsquo;t say a word, but
all of the first bunch of ants fell back
an&rsquo; stood guard, an&rsquo; the second bunch
of ants moved forward.
They repeated that a couple of times.
I watched &rsquo;em, too fascinated to say a
word.
After awhile I heard steps, an&rsquo; the
old goldsmith came along, puffin&rsquo; his
pipe regular, a puff for every two steps.
He reminded me of a freight engine,
boilin&rsquo; along on a down grade, hittin&rsquo;
her up regular.
He didn&rsquo;t say a word to me, nor to
the ants, but the ants heard him comin&rsquo;
an&rsquo; they all formed into two lanes with
their feelers wavin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; the goldsmith
walked down between those lanes an&rsquo;
up to the gold ledge. There he stuck
some more wood on the fire, raked
away some ashes an&rsquo; pawed out a bed
of coals.
THEN I saw he had a hammer an&rsquo;
a piece of metal that looked like
a reddish iron.. He pulled a skin
away an&rsquo; I saw lots of lumps an&rsquo; string-
ers of pure gold. It was a yellow,
frosty lookin&rsquo; sort of gold, and it was
so pure it glistened.
He picked up some of the pieces an&rsquo;
commenced to hammer &rsquo;em into orna-
ments.
&quot; What do yuh do with that stuff?&quot;
I asked the girl, wavin&rsquo; my hand care-
less like so she wouldn&rsquo;t think I was
much interested.
&ldquo;We trade it to the Fanti tribes,&rdquo;
she said. &quot; It is of no use, too soft to
make weapons, too heavy for arrow
points; but they use it to wear around
their fingers and ankles. They give us
many skins for it, and sometimes they
try to capture our territory and take
the entire ledge. If I had my way we
would stop making the ornaments. Our
people do not like the metal, and never
use it.Having it here just makes trou-
ble for us, and the Fantis are fierce
people. They are killing off our entire
tribe.&quot;
I nodded as wise as a dozen owls on
a limb.
&quot; Yeah,&quot; I told her, &quot; the stuff al-
ways makes trouble. Seems to me it &rsquo;d
be better to get rid of it.&quot;
The old goldsmith raised his head,
twisted his pipe in his mouth and
screwed his rheumy eyes at me. For
a minute or two he acted like he was
goin&rsquo; to say somethin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; then he went
back to his work.
It was a close call. Right then I
knew I&rsquo;d been goin&rsquo; too fast. But I
had my eye on that ledge o&rsquo; gold.
I guess it was a Fanti that saved
my life : if it hadn&rsquo;t been for seein&rsquo; him,
the ants would have got me sure.
Those ants looked pretty fierce when
I saw &rsquo;em boilin&rsquo; out in military for-
mation, but by the time it came dark
they didn&rsquo;t seem so much.
I got to thinkin&rsquo; things over. Bein&rsquo;
a slave wasn&rsquo;t near so bad as it might
be, an&rsquo; one of these days I was goin&rsquo;
to get away in the jungle an&rsquo; work
down to a port. All I needed was to
have about ninety pounds o&rsquo; pure gold
on my back when I went out an&rsquo; I
wouldn&rsquo;t be workin&rsquo; as a sailor no
more.
Sittin&rsquo; there in the warm night, while
the other folks had all rolled into their
huts, I got to thinkin&rsquo; things over. As
a slave, I wasn&rsquo;t given a hut. I could
sleep out. If the animals got bad I
could either build up the fire or climb
a tree. But there was fifty or sixty
other slaves, mostly captured warriors
of other tribes, an&rsquo; it wasn&rsquo;t so bad.
There was a place in the jungle
where the hills formed a bottle neck,
an&rsquo; there the tribe kept sentries so the
Fantis couldn&rsquo;t get in, an&rsquo; so the slaves
couldn&rsquo;t get out. Gettin&rsquo; through the
jungle where there wasn&rsquo;t a trail was
plain impossible.
I picked up a lot of this from the
girl, an&rsquo; a lot from usin&rsquo; my eyes.
NIGHT time the ants didn&rsquo;t seem
so much, an&rsquo; the gold seemed a
lot more. I wondered how I
could work it, an&rsquo; then a scheme hit
me. I&rsquo;d go out an&rsquo; make a quick run
for the ledge, chop off a few chunks o&rsquo;
quartz an&rsquo; then beat it back quick. I&rsquo;d
be in an&rsquo; out before the ants could come
boilin&rsquo; out of their thirty-foot ant hill.
It seemed a cinch.
I sneaked away an&rsquo; managed to find
my way down the trail to the gold
ledge. It was dark in the jungle. The
stars were all misty, an&rsquo; a squall was
workin&rsquo; somewheres out to sea. I could
hear the thunder of the surf an&rsquo; smell
the smells of the jungle. There wasn&rsquo;t
any noise outside of the poundin&rsquo; surf.
I&rsquo;&amp; taken my shoes off when I
dropped onto the raft, an&rsquo; they&rsquo;d got
lost while I was rollin&rsquo; around in the
water, so I was barefoot. The ground
had been beaten hard by millions of
bare feet, an&rsquo; so I made no noise. The
hard part was tellin&rsquo; just when I got
to the gold ledge, because I didn&rsquo;t want
to steer a wrong course an&rsquo; fetch up
against the ant heap.
I needn&rsquo;t have worried. I smelled
the faint smell o&rsquo; smoke, an&rsquo; then a pile
o&rsquo; coals gleamed red against the black
of the jungle night. It was the coals
of the goldsmith&rsquo;s fire. I chuckled to
myself. What a simple bunch o&rsquo; people
this tribe was!
An&rsquo; then, all of a sudden, I knew
some one else was there in the jungle.
It was that funny feelin&rsquo; that a man
can&rsquo;t describe. It wasn&rsquo;t a sound, be-
cause there wasn&rsquo;t any sound. It
wasn&rsquo;t anything I could see, because it
was as dark as the inside of a pocket.
But it was somethin&rsquo; that just tingled
on my skin an&rsquo; made my hair bristle.
I slipped back from the path and into
the dark of the jungle. Six feet from
the trail an&rsquo; I was hidden as well as
though I&rsquo;d been buried.
I got my eye up against a crack in
the leaves an&rsquo; watched the coals of the
camp fire, tryin&rsquo; to see if anything
moved.
All of a sudden those coals iust blot-
ted out.I thought maybe a leaf or a
vine had got in front of my eyes, but
there wasn&rsquo;t. It was just somethin&rsquo;
movin&rsquo; between me an&rsquo; the fire. An&rsquo;
then it stepped to one side, an&rsquo; I saw it,
a black man, naked, rushin&rsquo; into the
cliff of gold. He worked fast, that
boy. The light from the coals showed
me just a blur of black motion as he
chipped rocks from the ledge.
Then he turned and sprinted out.
I chuckied to myself.The boy had
got my system. It was a cinch, nothin&rsquo;
to it.
An&rsquo; then there came a yell of pain.
The black man began to do a devil&rsquo;s
dance, wavin&rsquo; his hands and legs. He&rsquo;d
got right in front of me, within ten
feet he was, an&rsquo; I could just make him
out when he moved.
From the ground there came a faint
whisperin&rsquo; noise, an&rsquo; then I could sense
things crawlin&rsquo;. I felt my blood turn
to luke-warm water as I thought of
the danger I was in. If those ants
found me there-
I was afraid to move, an&rsquo; I was
afraid to stand still.
But the black boy solved the prob-
lem for me. He made for a tree, climb-
inup a creeper like a monkey. Up in
the tree, I could hear his hands goin&rsquo;
as he tried to brush the ants off.And
he kept up a low, moanin&rsquo; noise, sort
of a chatter of agony.
I couldn&rsquo;t tell whether the ants were
leavin&rsquo; him alone or whether they were
watchin&rsquo; the bottom of the tree, waitin&rsquo;
for him.
But the creeper that he&rsquo;d climbed
up stretched against the starlit sky al-
most in front of my nose. I could see
it faintly outlined against the stars.
And then I noticed that it was ripplin&rsquo;
an&rsquo; swayin&rsquo;. For a minute I couldn&rsquo;t
make it out. Then I saw that those
ants were swarmin&rsquo; up the tree.
That was the end. The moanin&rsquo;
became a yellin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; then things began
to thud to the ground. That must be
the gold rock the fellow had packed
away with him, probably in a skin bag
slung over his shoulder.
Then the sounds quit. Everything
was silent. But I sensed the jungle
was full of activity, a horrid activity
that made me want to vomit. I could
smell somethin&rsquo; that must have been
blood, an&rsquo; there was a drip-drip from
the tree branches.
Then the coals fickered up an&rsquo; I
could see a little more. The ground
was black, swarmin&rsquo;. The ants were
goin&rsquo; back and forth, up an&rsquo; down the
creepers, up into the tree.
Finally somethin&rsquo; fell to the ground.
It couldn&rsquo;t have been a man, because
it was too small, hardly bigger than a
hunk o&rsquo; deer meat; but the firelight
flickered on it, an&rsquo; I could see that the
heap was all of a quiver. An&rsquo; it kept
gettin&rsquo; smaller an&rsquo; smaller. Then I
knew. The ants were finishin&rsquo; their
work.
I held my hands to my eyes, but I
couldn&rsquo;t shut out the sight If I&rsquo;d
moved I was afraid the ants would
turn to me. I hadn&rsquo;t been across the
dead line, but would the ants know it?
I shuddered and turned sick.
After awhile I looked out again. The
ground was bare. All of the ants were
back in their pile of sticks. The last
of the firelight flickered on a bunch o&rsquo;
white bones. Near by was the gleam
of yellow metal&ndash;gold from the rocks
the Fanti had stolen.
Sick, I went back along the trail,
back to the camp, not tellin&rsquo; anybody
where I&rsquo;d been or what I&rsquo;d seen. I still
wanted that gold, but I didn&rsquo;t want it
the way I&rsquo;d figured I did.
I DIDN&rsquo;T sleep much.They gave me
a tanned skin for a bed and that
was all. It was up to me to make
myself comfortable on the ground.
The ground was hard, but my bunk on
the ship had been hard. It was the
memory of that little black heap that
kept gettin&rsquo; smaller an&rsquo; smaller that
tortured my mind.
I lived through the night, an&rsquo; I lived
through the days that followed; but I
saw a lot that a white man shouldn&rsquo;t
see. After all, I guess we think too
much of life. Life didn&rsquo;t mean so
much to those people, an&rsquo; they didn&rsquo;t
feel it was so blamed precious.
And I worked out a cinch scheme for
the gold ledge. As the slave of Kk-Kk
I had to assist her in feedin&rsquo; the ants.
Every night I had to bring up some of
the fruit. Kk-Kk wouldn&rsquo;t let me
feed it to &rsquo;em. It was the custom of
the tribe that only the daughter of the
chief could feed the ants. But I got
close enough to find out a lot.
Those ants were trained. Kk-Kk
could walk among &rsquo;em an&rsquo; they took no
notice of her. She was the one who
fed &rsquo;em. The old goldsmith could
walk through &rsquo;em whenever he wanted
to, an&rsquo; they didn&rsquo;t pay any attention to
him. They&rsquo;d been trained that way.
But nobody else could cross the dead-
line.Let any one else come closer
than that an&rsquo; they&rsquo;d swarm out an&rsquo; get
started with their sickenin&rsquo; business.
Once they&rsquo;d started there was no gettin&rsquo;
away.
I saw &rsquo;em at work a couple of times
in the next week. They always
managed to get behind the man at the
gold ledge. Then they closed in on
him. No matter how fast he ran
they&rsquo;d swarm up his legs as he went
through &rsquo;em. Enough would get on
him so he couldn&rsquo;t go far, an&rsquo; there was
always a solid formation of two-inch
ants swarmin&rsquo; behind, ready to finish
the work.
But they fed &rsquo;em only one meal a
day, in the afternoon. I got to figger-
in&rsquo; what would happen if there should
be two feeders. They couldn&rsquo;t tell
which was the official feeder, an&rsquo; they&rsquo;d
been trained to let the official feeder to
go to the gold ledge.
I knew where they kept the pile of
dried fruits that the ants liked so well
An&rsquo; I started goin&rsquo; out to the ant pile
just before daybreak an&rsquo; givin&rsquo; &rsquo;em a
breakfast. I&rsquo;d take out a little of the
fruit so there wouldn&rsquo;t be any crumbs
left by the time the goldsmith came to
work.
At first I could see the ants were sus-
picious, but they ate the fruit. There
was one long, woolly fellow that
seemed to be the big boss, an&rsquo; he re-
ported to a glossy-backed ant that was
a king or queen or somethin&rsquo;. I got to
be good friends with the boss. He&rsquo;d
come an&rsquo; eat outa my hand. Then he&rsquo;d
go back an&rsquo; wave his feelers at the king
or queen, whichever it was, an&rsquo; finally,
the old boy, or old girl, got so it was
all right. There was nothin&rsquo; to it. I
was jake a million, one of the regular
guys. I could tell by a hundred little
things, the way they waved their
feelers, the way they came for the food.
Oh, I got to know &rsquo;em pretty well.
All of this time Kk-Kk was teachin&rsquo;
me things about the life an&rsquo; customs of
the tribe. I could see she was friendly.
She&rsquo;d had to learn the language of the
goldsmith, so that if anything should
happen to him she could educate
another one as soon as the tribe cap-
tured him.
For the tribe I didn&rsquo;t have no par-
ticular love.You should have seen
&rsquo;em in some of their devil-devil dances,
or seen &rsquo;em in the full moon when they
gave a banquet to their cousins, the
monkeys. Nope. I figured that any-
thing I could do to the tribe was some-
thin&rsquo;well done.But for Kk-Kk I had
different feelin&rsquo;s, an I could see that
she had different feelin&rsquo;s for me.
An&rsquo; all this time the monkey-man
was jealous. It was as plain as the
nose on my face. Not the nose on his,
&lsquo;cause his nose was flattened out like a
monkey&rsquo;s nose, just two holes in his
face with a black ring around it.
But he was in love with Kk-Kk, an&rsquo;
he wanted to buy her. In that country
the woman didn&rsquo;t have anything to say
about who she married, or whether she
was wife No. I or No. 5o. A man got
his wives by buyin&rsquo; &rsquo;em, and he could
have as many as he could buy an&rsquo;
keep.
After a coupla weeks I commenced
taking the gold. At first I just got
closer an&rsquo; closer to the dead line. I
can yet feel the cold sweat there was
on me the first time I crossed it. But
the ants figgered I was a regular guy,
part of the gang. They never said a
word. Finally, I walked right up to
the ledge, watchin&rsquo; the ground behind
me like a hawk. Then I scooped out
some o&rsquo; the crumbly quartz and worked
the gold out of it. After that it was
easy.
I didn&rsquo;t take much at any one time,
because I didn&rsquo;t want the goldsmith to
miss anything. I wasn&rsquo;t any hog.
Ninety pounds I wanted, an&rsquo; ninety
pounds was all I was goin&rsquo; to take, but
I wasn&rsquo;t a fool. I was goin&rsquo; to take it
a little at a time.</p>
<p>CHAPTER IV.
A FANTI RAID.</p>
<p>THEN came the night of the big
fight.
I was asleep, wrapped up in my.
skin robes, not because of the cold, be-
cause the nights are warm an&rsquo; steamy
down there, but to keep out as much of
the damp as I could, an&rsquo; to shut out
the night insects that liked my soft,
white skin.
There came a yell from a sentry up
the pass, an&rsquo; then a lot o&rsquo; whoopin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
then all hell broke loose.
There was a little moon, an&rsquo; by the
light o&rsquo; that moon I could see things
happenin&rsquo;.
Our warriors came boilin&rsquo; outa their
huts. One thing, they didn&rsquo;t have to
dress. All a guy had to do was grab
a spear an&rsquo; shieid, or climb up a tree
with a bow an&rsquo; arrow, an&rsquo; that was all
there was to it. He was dressed an&rsquo;
ready for business.
They evidently had the thing all re-
hearsed, &lsquo;cause some of &rsquo;em guarded
the trail with spears, an&rsquo; used thick
shields to ward off the poisoned ar-
rows, an&rsquo; others swarmed up in the
trees an&rsquo; shot little, poisoned arrows
into the thick of the mass of men that
were runnin&rsquo; down the trail.
It was a funny fight. There wasn&rsquo;t
any bangin&rsquo; of firearms, but there was
a lot o&rsquo; yellin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; in between yells
could be heard the whispers of the ar-
rows as they flitted through the night.
After awhile I could see that our
men were gettin&rsquo; the worst of it. I was
just a slave,an&rsquo; when a fight started
the women watched the slaves to see
they didn&rsquo;t make a break for liberty, or
start attackin&rsquo; our boys from the rear.
Maybe I&rsquo;d like to escape plenty, but
I wanted to do it my own way, an&rsquo;
stickin&rsquo;a spear in the back o&rsquo;one of our
boys didn&rsquo;t seem the way to do it. Then
again,I wouldn&rsquo;t be any better off after
I had escaped. My white skin would
make trouble for me with the others.
I wasn&rsquo;t the same as the other slaves,
most of whom were Fantis anyway.
They could make a break an&rsquo; be among
friends. If I made a hop I&rsquo;d just be
outa the fryin&rsquo; pan an&rsquo; in the fire.
But I wasn&rsquo;t used to bein&rsquo; a spectator
on the side lines when there was fight
goin&rsquo; on. So I took a look at the
situation.
When the alarm came in, the fire
watchers had piled a lot of fagots on
the big blaze, an&rsquo; all the fight was goin&rsquo;
on by what light came from the fire.
The fagots had burned off in the center
an&rsquo; there was a lot of flaming ends,
fire on one side, stick on the other.
I whispers a few words to Kk-Kk
an&rsquo; then we charged the fire, pickin
out the sticks, whirlin&rsquo; &rsquo;em an&rsquo; throwin&rsquo;
&rsquo;em into the mass o&rsquo; savages that was
borin&rsquo; into&rsquo;our men.
She&rsquo;d said somethin&rsquo; to the slaves,
an&rsquo; they was all lined up, throwin&rsquo;
sticks too. They wasn&rsquo;t throwin&rsquo; as
wholeheartedly as Kk-Kk an&rsquo;me was ;
but they was throwin&rsquo;&rsquo;em, an&rsquo; together
we managed to keep the air full of
brands.
It was a weird sight, those burnin&rsquo;
embers whirlin&rsquo; an&rsquo; spiralin&rsquo; through
the air, over the heads of our boys, an&rsquo;
plumb into the middle o&rsquo; the Fanti
Outfit.
I seen that I&rsquo;d missed a bet at that.
though, because we was really tearin&rsquo;
the fire to pieces, an&rsquo; it was goin&rsquo; to get
dark in a few minutes with the blaze
all bein&rsquo; thrown into the air that way.
One of our warriors had collected
himself a poisoned arrow, an&rsquo; he was
sprawled out,shield an&rsquo;spear lyin&rsquo; aside
of him. The arrows were whisperin&rsquo;
around pretty lively, an&rsquo; I seen a couple
of our slave fellows crumple up in a
heap. That shield looked good to me,
an&rsquo; while I was reachin&rsquo; for it, I got to
wonderin&rsquo; why not take the spear too.
There wasn&rsquo;t anybody to tell me not to,
so I grabbed &rsquo;em both, an&rsquo; then I
charged into the melee.
Them savages fought more or less
silent after the first rush. There was
plenty of yells, but they were in-
dividual, isolated yells, not no steady
war cries. I&rsquo;d picked a good time to
strut my stuff, because there was more
or less of a lull when I started my
charge.
MY clothes had been torn off my
back. What few rags remained
I&rsquo;d thrown away, wantin&rsquo; to get
like the natives as fast as possible. My
skin was still white, although it had
tanned up a bit, but there wasn&rsquo;t any
mistakin&rsquo; me.
Our boys had got accustomed to the
idea of a white man bein&rsquo; a slave, an&rsquo;
they hadn&rsquo;t run into the white men like
the Fanti outfit had.Those Fantis
had probably had a little white meat on
their bill o&rsquo; fare for a change o&rsquo; diet;
an&rsquo; some expedition or other had come
along an&rsquo; mopped up on &rsquo;em. Any-
how, the idea of a white man as a
fightin&rsquo; machine had registered good
an&rsquo; strong with &rsquo;em.
So when they heard one awful yell.
an&rsquo; seen a naked white man chargin&rsquo;
down on &rsquo;em with spear an&rsquo; shield,
yellin&rsquo; like a maniac, an&rsquo; with all the
whirlin&rsquo; firebrands sailin&rsquo; through the
air, they thought it was time to quit.
There&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; funny about a nig-
ger. They can say all they want to,
but his fears are the big part of him,
no matter how brave he gets.Those
whirlin&rsquo; brands o&rsquo; fire wasn&rsquo;t makin&rsquo;
&rsquo;em feel any too good, an&rsquo; then when
I come chargin&rsquo; down on &rsquo;em hell bent
for election it was too much.
They wavered for a second, then
gave a Iot of yells on their own an&rsquo;
started pell-mell down the trail, each
one tryin&rsquo; to walk all over the heels of
the boy in front.
Funny thing about a bunch of men
once turnin&rsquo; tail to a fight. When
they do it they get into a panic. It
ain&rsquo;t fear like one man or two men
would feel fear. It&rsquo;s a panic, a blind
somethin&rsquo; that keeps &rsquo;em from thinkin&rsquo;
or feelin&rsquo;. All they want to do is to
run. There ain&rsquo;t any fight left in &rsquo;em.
It was awful what our crowd done
to those boys. As soon as they started
to run, the laddies with the spears
started makin&rsquo; corpses. An&rsquo; I was
right in the lead o&rsquo; our bunch. Don&rsquo;t
ask me how I got them. I don&rsquo;t know.
I only know I was yellin&rsquo; an&rsquo; chargin&rsquo;,
when the whole Fanti outfit turned tail,
an&rsquo; there I was, playin&rsquo; pig-stickin&rsquo; with
the backs of a lot o&rsquo; runnin&rsquo; Fanti
warriors for targets.
We gave up the chase after awhile.
We&rsquo;d done enough damage, an&rsquo; there
was a chance o&rsquo; trouble runnin&rsquo; too far
into the jungle. The crowd ahead
might organize an&rsquo; turn on us, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;d
got pretty well strung out along the
jungle trail.
I herded the bovs back, an&rsquo; there was.
a regular road o&rsquo; Fanti dead between
us an&rsquo; where the main part o&rsquo; the battle
had taken place.
Well, they called a big powwow
around the camp fire after that. I seen
Kk-Kk talkin&rsquo; to her old man, Yik-Yik,
an&rsquo; I guess she was pretty proud of her
slave. Anyhow, Yik-Yik sucked his
lips into his mouth like he did when he
was thinkin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; then he called to me.
He got me in a ring o&rsquo; warriors be-
fore the fire, an&rsquo; he made a great
speech. Then he handed me a bloody
spear and shield, an&rsquo; daubed my chest
with some sort of paint, an&rsquo; painted a
coupla rings around my eyes, an&rsquo; put
three stripes o&rsquo; paint on my cheeks.
Then all the warriors started jump-
in&rsquo; around the fire, stampin&rsquo; their feet,
wailin&rsquo; some sort of a weird chant.
Every few steps they&rsquo;d all slam their
feet down on the hard ground in uni-
son, an&rsquo; the leaves on the trees rattled
with their stamping. It was a wild
night.
Kk-Kk was interpreter. She told
me they were givin&rsquo; me my liberty an&rsquo;
adoptin&rsquo; me into the tribe as a great
warrior. It wasn&rsquo;t right that such a
mighty fighter should be the slave of a
woman, she told me.
Well, there&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; funny about
women the world over. They all talk
peace an&rsquo; cooin&rsquo; dove stuff, but they all
like to see a son-of-a-gun of a good
scrap. Kk-Kk&rsquo;s eyes were soft an&rsquo;
glowin&rsquo; with pride, an&rsquo; I could see she
was as proud of me as though she&rsquo;d
been my mother or sweetheart or some-
thin&rsquo;.
An&rsquo; seein&rsquo; that look in her eyes did
somethin&rsquo; to me. I&rsquo;d been gettin&rsquo; sorta
sweet on Kk-Kk without knowin&rsquo; it.
She was a pretty enough lass for all
her chocolate color. An&rsquo; she was a
square shooter. She&rsquo;d stuck up for me
from the first, an&rsquo; if it hadn&rsquo;t been for
her I&rsquo;d have been a meal instead of a
slave. It was only natural that I should
get to like her more an&rsquo; more. Then.
when I&rsquo;d got used to the native ideas
an&rsquo; all that, she got to lookin&rsquo; pretty
good to me.
ANYHOW, there I was in love with
heryes, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m still in love
with her. Maybe I did go na-
tive.What of it? There&rsquo;s worse
things, an&rsquo; Kk-Kk was a square shoot-
er, I don&rsquo;t care what color her skin
was. An&rsquo; remember that she was the
daughter of a king. There was royal
blood in her veins, an&rsquo; that makes a
difference, race or color or what not.
Anyhow, like it or not, I was in love
with her, an&rsquo; I still am.
Oh, I know I&rsquo;m an old man now
Kk-Kk is awful old now if she&rsquo;s livin&rsquo;
because those natives get old quickly,
an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t no spring chicken myself.
But I love her just the same.
Well, a white man is funny about
his women. He ain&rsquo;t got no patience
When he falls in love he falls strong,
an&rsquo; he wants his girl. I didn&rsquo;t have
patience like the monkey-man had. I
couldn&rsquo;t wait around. I went to Kk-
Kk the next day an&rsquo; told her about it.
It was at the ant meal time when we
was packin&rsquo; fruit to &rsquo;em. I was still
helpin&rsquo; her even if I wasn&rsquo;t a slave any
more. I did it because I wanted to.
Well, I told her; her eyes got all
shiny, an&rsquo; she dropped the dried fruit
in a heap an&rsquo; threw her arms around
my neck, an&rsquo; she cried a bit, an&rsquo; made
soft noises in the graduated monkey
talk that is the real language of the
tribe. Bein&rsquo; all excited that way, she
forgot  the language of the goldsmith
an&rsquo; went back to the talk of her folks.
The ants came an&rsquo; got the fruit, an
they crawled all over our feet eatin&rsquo; it.
If she hadn&rsquo;t been so happy, an&rsquo; if I
hadn&rsquo;t been so much in love we&rsquo;d both
have realized what it meant, the ants
crawlin&rsquo; over us that way an&rsquo;not offer-
in&rsquo; to bite me, or actin&rsquo; hostile at all.
It showed that I&rsquo;d been makin&rsquo; friends
with &rsquo;em on the side.
Well, after awhile she broke away.
an&rsquo; then she did some more cryin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
explained that she was the daughter of
the chief. The man that married her
would be the chief of the tribe some
day. That is, he&rsquo;d be the husband of the
tribe&rsquo;s queen.
Now in that tribe the men bought
their wives. The man who married
Kk-Kk was the man who&rsquo;d buy her
hand from her old man. But, bein&rsquo;
as she was the daughter of the chief.
an&rsquo; the future queen of the tribe, it &rsquo;d
take more wealth to buy her hand than
any single man in the tribe could
muster.
She told me how many skins an&rsquo;
how many hogs an&rsquo; how much dried
meat an&rsquo; how many bows an&rsquo; arrows
an&rsquo; spears, an&rsquo; how many pounds of
the native tobacco an&rsquo; alil that would
be required.
I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to the
long list of stuff she rattled off. I had
over sixty pounds of pure gold cached
then, an&rsquo; I felt like a millionaire.
After all, what was all this native
stuff compared with what I had? I
was a rich man for a common, ordi-
nary sailor boy. I could take that gold
right then an&rsquo; walk into any of the
world&rsquo;s market places an&rsquo; buy what I
wanted. Yes, an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s even been
cases of women of the higher muck-a-
mucks sellin&rsquo; themselves or their
daughters in marriage for iess than
sixty pounds of pure gold.
Well, I laughed at Kk-Kk an&rsquo; told
her not to worry. I&rsquo;d buy her hand
from the old man. I didn&rsquo;t worry
about the price. I was a sailor lad, an&rsquo;
I had the hot blood of youth in my
veins, an&rsquo; I was in love with Kk-Kk,
an&rsquo; she was standin&rsquo; there with her
eyes all limpid an&rsquo; misty an&rsquo; her arms
around my neck, an I had sixty
pounds of pure gold. What more
could a man want?
An&rsquo; then I heard a noise an&rsquo; looked
Up.
There was the monkey-man, squat-
tin&rsquo; on the branch of a tree an&rsquo; lookin&rsquo;
at us, and his lips were workin&rsquo; back
an&rsquo; forth from his teeth. He wasn&rsquo;t
sayin&rsquo; a word, but his lips worked up
an&rsquo; down, an&rsquo; every time they&rsquo;d work,
his teeth showed through.
&ndash; I stiffened a bit, although it wasn&rsquo;t
that I was afraid. Right then I felt
that I could lick all the monkey-men
in the world, either one at a time or
all together.
Kk-Kk was frightened.I could
feel the shivers runnin&rsquo; up an&rsquo; down
her arms, an&rsquo; she made iittle scared
noises with her lips.
But the monkey-man didn&rsquo;t say any-
thing. When he saw that we knew he
was watchin&rsquo;, he reached up his great
arms, caught the branch of a tree above
him, swung off into space, caught an-
other limb with his great feet, an&rsquo;
swirled off into the forest. All that
was left was the twilight an&rsquo; the chat-
terin&rsquo; of a bunch of monkeys, an&rsquo; the
whimperin&rsquo; noises Kk-Kk was makin&rsquo;.
I PATTED the girl on the shoulder.
Let the monkey-man storm around
through the tree-tops. A lot of
good that would do him. He wasn&rsquo;t
in a position to buy the hand of Kk-
Kk, an&rsquo; he wasn&rsquo;t likely to be in the
position. I had a big chunk of pure
gold stored up. I didn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;d be
any trick at all to complete the pur-
chase.
By next day, though, I knew I was
up against a funny problem. I had
ail the gold I could carry, but gold
wasn&rsquo;t any good. I had enough of it
to purchase a whole tannery full of
choice skins, but I couldn&rsquo;t trade the
gold for skins. The tribe I was with
didn&rsquo;t care anything for the gold ex-
cept as somethin&rsquo; to trade to the Fanti
boys. An&rsquo; all the tradin&rsquo; was done by
the chief. The tribal custom prohibited
the others from doin&rsquo; any tradin&rsquo;, even
from havin&rsquo; any of the gold.
I commenced to see it wasn&rsquo;t as sim-
ple as I&rsquo;d thought it was goin&rsquo; to be.
An&rsquo; all the while I got more an&rsquo;more
in love with Kk-Kk. She was just the
sort of a woman a real adventurin&rsquo;
man wants. She&rsquo;d keep her head in
any emergency.. She was strong an&rsquo;
tender. There wasn&rsquo;t an ache nor a
pain in her system. When she moved
she walked like it wasn&rsquo;t any effort at
all.If the trees looked easier than the
trail she&rsquo;d swing up in them an&rsquo; go
from branch to branch, light as a
feather driftin&rsquo; down wind.
I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; you she was strong as an
ox an&rsquo; as graceful as a panther. A
woman like that &rsquo;d go with a man any-
where. An&rsquo; she was sweet an&rsquo; tender.
When she thought I was blue for the
white race an&rsquo; home an&rsquo; all that, she&rsquo;d
draw my head down against her breast
an&rsquo; croon to me as soft an&rsquo; low as the
wind sighin&rsquo; through the tops of the
jungle trees.
I wanted to take her away with me.
Any one could see the tribe was
doomed. The very gold that gave them
their tradin&rsquo; power was their curse.
The Fantis desired that gold. They
might get beat in one battle, might get
beat in a thousand, but as long as the
ledge was there, there&rsquo;d be invaders
fightin&rsquo; to get possession of it.
It&rsquo;d be only a question of time until
the tribe was wiped out, defeated, cap-
tured, an&rsquo; the women turned into
slaves. They couldn&rsquo;t stand the cli-
mate in the interior. Four or five miles
back from the ocean was their limit.
The Fantis wanted that gold ledge.
Every so often there&rsquo;d be a battle, an&rsquo;
when it was over there&rsquo;d be dead an&rsquo;
wounded. There was always plenty
more of the enemy, but there was
a few less of our boys after every
fight.
If I could get away an&rsquo; take Kk-Kk
with me, an&rsquo; a pack load of gold, what
I could carry an&rsquo; what Kk-Kk could
carry, we&rsquo;d be fixed for life.We could
go out into the cities an&rsquo; hold up our
heads with any of &rsquo;em.
But I knew I was goin&rsquo; to have
trouble gettin&rsquo; Kk-Kk to see things
that way. I might get her to leave
with me, but she&rsquo;d been brought up
with the idea that her obligation to
the tribe was sacred. She wouldn&rsquo;t
take any of the gold. You see she
hadn&rsquo;t ever had to deal with money,
an&rsquo; she did what she thought was right,
not what she thought would make the
most money for her.
While I was thinkin&rsquo; things over,
the monkey-man comes swingin&rsquo; into
the council an&rsquo; tells &rsquo;em he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to
buy the hand of Kk-Kk at the next
full moon. That was all he said. He
wouldn&rsquo;t tell &rsquo;em where he was goin&rsquo;
to get the stuff or anything.
But it was enough to get me wor-
ried. An I could see it bothered
Kk-Kk.
THERE was lots o&rsquo; wild rumors
goin&rsquo; along in those days. There
was a report that the Ashantis an&rsquo;
the Fantis were gettin&rsquo; together for a
joint attack. They was determined to
get that gold ledge.
I tried to get Kk-Kk to advise the
tribe to leave the thing. Without that
gold they&rsquo;d be safe from attack, an&rsquo;
the gold didn&rsquo;t mean so much to &rsquo;em
anyhow.
But they were just like the rest of
the nations, if a man could compare
a savage tribe with a nation. They
wanted their gold, even when it wasn&rsquo;t
doin&rsquo; the rank an&rsquo; file of &rsquo;em any good.
They were goin&rsquo; to fight for&rsquo;it, lay
down their lives for it if they had to,
an&rsquo; all the time only the ruler had any
right to use the gold to trade with.
They knew they could have peace
by goin&rsquo; away. They must have seen
they couldn&rsquo;t last long stayin&rsquo; there.
Every battle left &rsquo;em a little weaker.
But no, they must stay an&rsquo; die for their
ledge of gold, an&rsquo; they didn&rsquo;t even
know the value of it.It&rsquo;s funny about
gold that way.
There was another rumor goin&rsquo;
around that made me do a lot of think-
in&rsquo;, an&rsquo;that was of a white man that
was camped a couple of days march
away. He had a big outfit with him,
an&rsquo; he was shootin&rsquo; big game an&rsquo; pros-
pectin&rsquo; around in general.
A wild idea got into my head that if
I could sneak away an&rsquo; get to him with
fifty or sixty pounds of gold I could
trade it for mirrors, guns, blankets an&rsquo;
what not that would look like a mil-
lion dollars to the old chief. Then I
could buy Kk-Kk an&rsquo; maybe I could
talk her into goin&rsquo; away with me.
I really had enough gold, but I was
gettin&rsquo; a little hoggish. I wanted more.
The love of a woman like Kk-Kk had
ought to make a man richer than the
richest king in the world, but I was a
white man, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d been taught to wor-
ship gold along with God.
In fact, I&rsquo;d only had that God wor-
ship idea taught me on Sundays when
I was a kid. On week days the god
was gold. My folks had been rated
as bein&rsquo; pretty religious as common
folks go. But even they hadn&rsquo;t tried
to carry religion past Sunday. Gold
was the god six days of the week, an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;d been brought up with the white
man&rsquo;s idea.
So I had to get me a little more gold.
I wanted it so I could go to the white
man&rsquo;s camp with all the gold I could
carry an&rsquo; still have as much left behind.
hidden in the ground, waitin&rsquo; for me to
come back.
The next mornin&rsquo; I decided to take
a chance an&rsquo; scoop out a big lot o&rsquo;
quartz. I got out with the food for
the ants all right ; I hadn&rsquo;t even thought
about troubie with them for a long
while. They&rsquo;d quit bein&rsquo; one of my
worries. I walked over to the ledge
and dug into the quartz.
An&rsquo; then somethin&rsquo; funny struck me.
It was a feelin&rsquo; like somethin&rsquo; was bor-
in&rsquo; into my back. I whirled around
an&rsquo; there was the monkey-man sittin&rsquo;
on a limb, watchin&rsquo; me.
He was up in a tree, squatted on the
limb, his hands holdin&rsquo; a bow with one
of them poison arrows on the string an&rsquo;
it was then I noticed the way his toes
came around the under side of the limb
an&rsquo; held him firm. Funny how a fel-
low&rsquo;ll notice things like that when he&rsquo;s
figurin&rsquo; he has an appointment in eter-
nity right away.</p>
<p>CHAPTER V.
THE MONKEY-MAN.</p>
<p>I STARED into the monkey-man&rsquo;s
eyes, an&rsquo; he stared back. I&rsquo;d read
somewhere that a white man always
has the advantage over the other races
because there&rsquo;s some kind of a racial
inferiority that the other fellows de-
velop in a pinch.
Maybe it&rsquo;s true, an&rsquo; maybe it ain&rsquo;t.
I only know I stared at the monkey-
man, an&rsquo; he fidgeted his fingers around
on the bow string.
I was .caught red-handed.One of
those poison arrows would almost drop
me in my tracks. I wouldn&rsquo;t have a
chance to get outside of the dead line.
It looked like curtains for me. Then
a funny thing happened. I thought at
the time it was because of my starin&rsquo;
eyes an&rsquo; the racial inferiority an&rsquo; what
not. Now I know the real reason. But
the monkey-man lowered the bow,
blinked his eyes a couple of times, just
like a monkey puzzlin&rsquo; over a new idea,
an&rsquo; then he reached up one of those
long paws, grabbed a branch overhead,
swung up into the higher trees an&rsquo; was
off.
It looked like he&rsquo;d gone to get some
witnesses, an&rsquo; it was up to me to bury
my gold an&rsquo; be snappy about it. I
could see the ants were finishin&rsquo; up
the last of the feed I&rsquo;d given &rsquo;em, an&rsquo;
I wouldn&rsquo;t have to be afraid of some
Of that bein&rsquo; left.
I took the gold an&rsquo; sprinted for the
place where I kept it hid. I buried
the new batch with the other, an&rsquo; then
strolled back to the clearin&rsquo;, tryin&rsquo; to
look innocent.
I felt a big weight on my chest.
Somehow I felt the monkey-man was
goin&rsquo; to get me. If he could make his
Charges stick I was sure due to be a
meal before night.
But the funny part of it was he
didn&rsquo;t make any charges. He even
wasn&rsquo;t there at all. Funny. I walked
around an&rsquo; passed the few words of
the language I&rsquo;d picked up with some
of the warriors, an&rsquo; then I saw Kk-Kk.
It was sort of a lazy life, livin&rsquo; there
that way. The tradin&rsquo; power of the
gold ornaments gave the tribe the bulge
on things. They didn&rsquo;t have to work
so awfui hard. Funny, too, they didn&rsquo;t
savvy rightly about the gold.&rsquo; They
thought it wasn&rsquo;t the metal, but the
way the goldsmith worked it up into
rings an&rsquo; bracelets an&rsquo; such like that
made it valuable. Gold as such they
couldn&rsquo;t understand.
Anyhow, the warriors didn&rsquo;t have
anything to do except a little huntin&rsquo;
once in awhile. The women did all of
the real work. an&rsquo; there wasn&rsquo;t much
of that.
Kk-Kk an&rsquo; me walked down to the
beach an&rsquo; I watched the green surf
thunderin&rsquo; in. Her arm was nestled
around me an&rsquo; her head was up against
my shoulder. I felt a possessory sort
of feelin&rsquo;like I owned the whole world.
I patted her head an&rsquo; told her there
wasn&rsquo;t anything to be afraid of, that
I was goin&rsquo; to make good on buyin&rsquo;
her an&rsquo; that I&rsquo;d boost any price the
monkey-man was able to raise.
She felt curious, but when she seen
I didn&rsquo;t want to answer questions she
let things go without talkin&rsquo;. She was
a wonderful girl, the kind that any
man could be proud of, particularly a
rough, seafarin&rsquo; man that had sailed
all the seas of the world an&rsquo; knocked
about in all sorts of weather.
I broke away from her when the sun
was well up.I knew she&rsquo;d go down
to the ocean with the tribe for her bath.
That was my chance. I raced into
the jungle to the place where I&rsquo;d left
my gold.
ALL that a man could pack away
was gone. There wasn&rsquo;t over
twenty pounds left.The ground
had been dug up an&rsquo; the gold rooted
up. It was there in the sun, glistenin&rsquo;
soft an&rsquo; yellow against the green of the
jungle an&rsquo; the rich brown of the earth.
For a minute my heart made a flip-
flop, an&rsquo; then I knew. The monkey-
man hadn&rsquo;t given the alarm at all. He&rsquo;d
come to know somethin&rsquo; of the power
of the gold, an&rsquo; when he saw me feed-
in&rsquo; the ants an&rsquo; helpin&rsquo; myself at the
gold ledge he realized I must have a
bunch of it cached away. That had
been why he hadn&rsquo;t shot me with a
poisoned arrow. He&rsquo;d swung up out
of sight in the high trees an&rsquo;waited for
me to lead him to the place where I&rsquo;d
buried the gold. With his trainin&rsquo; in
slippin&rsquo; through the branches of the
trees there hadn&rsquo;t been anything to it.
He followed me as easy as a bird could
flit through the branches.
Now he&rsquo;d taken all the gold he could
carry.He&rsquo;d been in a hurry. He
hadn&rsquo;t stopped to bury the rest some
place else,even, or to cover it over
with earth. Why?There was only one
answer. He&rsquo;d made a bluff about buy-
.in&rsquo; Kk-Kk from her old man, an&rsquo; he
wanted to make good. He&rsquo;d heard
about the white man an&rsquo; his camp, an&rsquo;
he&rsquo;d got the same idea I&rsquo;d had, an&rsquo;
he&rsquo;d got a head start on me.
I had a skin pouch with a couple of
straps goin&rsquo; over the shoulders. I load-
ed the gold that was left in it an&rsquo; made
my start. I knew there&rsquo;d be trouble
gettin&rsquo; past the sentries at the bottle-
neck, but I couldn&rsquo;t wait for night.
The monkey-man could slip through in
the trees.I&rsquo;d have to rely on bluff
and nerve.
It wasn&rsquo;t gettin&rsquo; past &rsquo;em that was
the hard part. It was carryin&rsquo; the gold
out. As a warrior, I was entitled to
go out in the jungle to hunt, to come
an&rsquo; go as I pleased. It was what was
in that skin pouch that would make the
trouble.
Then I got another idea. There&rsquo;d
been a kill the day before of some little
sort of an antelope that ran around
the jungle. I knew where some of the
meat was. The gold didn&rsquo;t amount to
much in size, an&rsquo; I raced over an&rsquo;
stuffed some animal meat on the top
of it. It was sink or swim, an&rsquo; I
couldn&rsquo;t wait to fix up any fancy plan.
I grabbed a spear an&rsquo; a shield an&rsquo;
started down the path. The sentries
flashed their white teeth at me an&rsquo;
blinked their round eyes. Then one of
&rsquo;em noticed the pack on my back an&rsquo;
he flopped his spear down while he
came over to investigate.
I didn&rsquo;t act like I was the least bit
frightened. I even opened the sack
myself, an&rsquo; I made a lot of motions.
I pointed to the sun, an&rsquo; I swung my
hand up an&rsquo; down four times tellin&rsquo;
&rsquo;em that I&rsquo;d be away four days. Then
I pointed to the meat an&rsquo; to my mouth,
explainin&rsquo; that it was for food.
I threw in a little comic stuff an&rsquo;
had &rsquo;em laughin&rsquo;. They laughed easy.
those jungle men who were so blamed
ignorant they didn&rsquo;t know the power
of gold.
It was a cinch. I.was on my way.
headin&rsquo; into hostile territory, knowin&rsquo;
that the Fantis were in the country an&rsquo;
that I&rsquo;d be a fine meal for &rsquo;em. It&rsquo;s
a funny sensation, figgerin&rsquo; that you&rsquo;re
only valuable for the meat you can be
made into, estimatin&rsquo; your calory value
On the hoof.
Anyhow, the thing had been started.
an&rsquo; I had to see it through. After I
got into the country where the white
men went, the color of my skin should
protect me from the tribes.The white
man gets respect from the blacks. He
kills a lot of blacks to do it, but he
gets results.
It was the first few miles that had
me worried. I had to go through the
Eso country an&rsquo; into the Nitchwa coun-
try, an&rsquo; I was in a hurry. I couldn&rsquo;t go
slow an&rsquo; cautious like, an&rsquo; I couldn&rsquo;t
take to the trees like the monkey-man
could.
THE first day I almost got caught
A bunch of Fanti warriors came
down the trail. I swung off to
one side, workin&rsquo; my way into the
thickest of the jungle, an&rsquo; hidin&rsquo; in the
shadows. I thought sure I was caught,
because those boys have eyes that can
see in the dark.But I got by.
The second day I didn&rsquo;t see a soul.
I was gettin&rsquo; in a more open, rollin
country, an&rsquo; I only had a general idea
where I was goin&rsquo;. There was a hill
that stood up pretty well over the rest
of the country, an&rsquo; I got up on that an
climbed a tree.
Just at dusk I see &rsquo;em, hundreds
of fires twinklin&rsquo; through the dusk like
little stars. I figgered that &rsquo;d be the
camp of the white man.
It ain&rsquo;t healthy to go through the
jungle at night. There are too many
animals who have picked up the habits
of man an&rsquo; figger that turn-about is fair
play. They relish the flesh of a man,
more particularly a white man, as a
rare delicacy.
We don&rsquo;t think nothin&rsquo; o&rsquo; stalkin&rsquo; a
nice buck an&rsquo; havin&rsquo; our mouth water
an&rsquo; think how tasty he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to be
broiled over a bed o&rsquo; coals. But if the
buck turns around an&rsquo; starts stalkin&rsquo;
us an&rsquo; lickin&rsquo; his chops over how nice
we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to taste it&rsquo;s a different af-
fair altogether.
I know, because for two hours I
worked through the country with eyes
glarin&rsquo; out of the jungle all around, an&rsquo;
soft steps fallin&rsquo; into the trail behind
me. They were animals, stalkin&rsquo; along
behind, a little afraid of the white man
smell, hesitatin&rsquo; a bit about closin&rsquo; the
gap an&rsquo; makin&rsquo; a supper outa me, but
feelin&rsquo; their mouths water at the
thought.
Yes, sir, I know how it feels to be
hunted by somethin&rsquo; that&rsquo;s just figger-
in&rsquo; how nice you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to taste after
he&rsquo;s got his paws on you.
Well, finally I came to the camp of
the white man. I could see him sittin&rsquo;
there, all bearded an&rsquo; tanned. He was
wearin&rsquo; white clothes an&rsquo; sittin&rsquo; before
a fire with a lot o&rsquo; native servants wait-
in&rsquo; around with food an&rsquo; drink an&rsquo; what
not.
I walked up to him, pretty well all
in, an&rsquo; motioned to my mouth. I&rsquo;d
been so used to talkin&rsquo; to the natives
that way that for a moment I forgot
that this man talked my language.
Then I told him. &quot; I come to trade,&quot;
I says, an&rsquo; dumped out the gold on the
ground.
He went up outa the canvas chair
like he&rsquo;d been&rsquo;shot.
&quot; Another one!&quot; he yelled. &ldquo;An&rsquo;
this one&rsquo;s white!&rdquo;
Then he clapped his hands, an&rsquo; black
men came runnin&rsquo; up an&rsquo; grabbed me.
&ldquo;Where did yuh get it? Where is
it? Is there any more? How long will
it take to get there?&rdquo; he yells at me,
his face all purple, with the veins stand-
in&rsquo; out an&rsquo; the eyes bulgin&rsquo;.
I&rsquo;d forgotten how excited white men
got at the sight of gold.
&ldquo;Gold! Gold!&ldquo;he goes on. &quot; The
country must be lousy with gold!
There was a big ape hanging around
camp this morning. He seemed a high-
er species of ape, almost human. I
stalked him and shot him for a speci-
men. Can you imagine my surprise
when I found that he was carrying a
skin filled with gold?
&quot; And this is the same gold.I&rsquo;d rec-
ognize it anywhere. Come, my good
man, come and tell me if you have
ever seen a similar creature to this
great ape. I have preserved him in al-
cohol and intend to carry him intact to
the British Museum.&rdquo;
I COULD feel myself turnin&rsquo; sorta
sick at the idea, but there was noth-
in&rsquo; for it. He was draggin&rsquo; me
along to a big vat. There was the
monkey-man, a bullet hole in his back
in his back, mind you.He hadn&rsquo;t
even shot him from the front, but had
sneaked around to the rear. The
&quot; specimen&rdquo; was floatin&rsquo; around in the
alcohol.
I turned away.
&quot; Tell me, tell me,&quot; pleads the guy,
&quot; do you know him? Your gold comes
from the same source. Perhaps you
have seen others&rsquo;of the same spe-
cies.
&quot; After I shot him I was overcome
with remorse because he might have
showed me the way to the gold deposit
if I had merely captured him. But I
shot before I knew of the gold.&quot;
I did some rapid thinkin&rsquo;. If this
bird thought I knew where the gold
came from he&rsquo;d force me to show him,
or perhaps he&rsquo;d kill me an&rsquo; stick me in
alcohol. So I looked sad..
&quot; No, I don&rsquo;t know,&quot; I tells him.&quot; I
saw this man-monkey carryin&rsquo; a skin
full of somethin&rsquo; heavy. I followed
along until he sat down the sack an&rsquo;
went to sleep. Then I sneaked up, seen
it was gold, an&rsquo; figgered a monkey-man
didn&rsquo;t have no use for gold.&quot;
He nods his head. &quot; Quite right, my
friend. Quite right. A monkey can
have no use for gold. And how about
yourself? You possibly have no use
for it. At any rate you admit it was
part of the gold that belonged to the
monkey, so you should restore it to the
original pile, and I will take charge of
It.
I seen this bird was one of the kind
that want everything for nothin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
insist that a guy mustn&rsquo;t hold out on
&rsquo;em.
I told him that I&rsquo;m only too glad to
oblige, but I want some calicos an&rsquo;
some mirrors an&rsquo; blankets an&rsquo; a gun
an&rsquo; some ammunition, an&rsquo; some huntin&rsquo;
knives an&rsquo; beads. After that he can
have the gold.
We dickered for awhile, an&rsquo; finally
I dusted out, takin&rsquo; two porters with
me, frightened to death but loaded
down with junk. I was carryin&rsquo; the
rifle, an&rsquo; I was watchin&rsquo; my back trail.
The old boy might figure I was a speci-
men.
I got back all right. We had one
brush with the Fanti outfit, but the
roar of the gun made &rsquo;em take to the
tall timber. I had the porters lay the
junk down about two miles from the
place where our tribe was camped, an&rsquo;
I sneaked it up to the bottle-neck my-
Self, carryin&rsquo; three loads of it. Then I
came on up to the sentries, shook
hands, walked past an&rsquo; got a couple
of warriors to help me with the plun-
der.
Kk-Kk was there, all dolled up in all
her finery, paradin&rsquo; around the village.
That&rsquo;s a custom they got from the
Fantis. When a girl&rsquo;s offered for sale
in marriage she decks herself out with
everything the family&rsquo;s got an&rsquo; parades
around the village. That&rsquo;s a notice to
bidders.
I knew Kk-Kk was doin&rsquo; it for me.
She had to comply with the customs of
the tribe, but she figgered I was the
only bird that could make the grade
an&rsquo; she trusted to my resourcefulness
to bring home the bacon.</p>
<p>CHAPTER VI.
AFRICAN JUSTICE.</p>
<p>MY stuff was a riot. When I had
the fellows spread it out on the
ground the boys&rsquo; eyes stuck out
until their foreheads bulged. Most of
&rsquo;em had never seen the trade goods of
the white man. They&rsquo;d been kept
pretty well isolated with the hostile
Fanti outfit hemmin&rsquo; &rsquo;em in by land
an&rsquo; the open ocean thunderin&rsquo; on the
beach.
The knives made the hit. The war-
riors were hunters enough to appre-
ciate a keen-edged bit of shiny steel.
The blankets didn&rsquo;t take very well,
neither did the calico, but the knives,
the mirrors an&rsquo; the beads were drawin&rsquo;
cards that couldn&rsquo;t be beat.
Old Yik-Yik screwed up his eyes
an&rsquo; sucked in his mouth, the way he
had when he was thinkin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; then he
jabbers out a bunch of graduated
monkey talk. The goldsmith was
there an&rsquo; he blinks his rheumy eyes an&rsquo;
sticks out his hand.
&quot; The old bird says you&rsquo;ve bought
the girl,&quot; he tells me.
I could feel my heart do a flip-flop.
It was all matter-of-fact to them, the
buyin&rsquo; of a wife, even if she did happen
to be the future queen of&rsquo;the tribe.
But to me there was only one Kk-Kk
in the world, an&rsquo; now she was to be
mine. The only man that knew my se-
cret was the monkey-man, an&rsquo; he was
floatin&rsquo; around in a vat of alcohol. I
could settle down in the tribe an&rsquo; be
happy the rest of my life.
But, in spite of it all, I was feelin&rsquo;
off color. My head felt light. When
I&rsquo;d turn it quick it seemed to keep right
on goin&rsquo; for a couple of revolutions.
An&rsquo; my feet felt funny, as though they
wasn&rsquo;t settin&rsquo; firm on the ground.
But what of it? Wasn&rsquo;t I goin&rsquo; to
marry Kk-Kk? What was a little bil-
iousness more or less?
An&rsquo; then there was a bunch o&rsquo; yellin&rsquo;
I looked up an&rsquo; seen a couple of the sen-
tries bringin&rsquo; in a captive. Another
meal, I thought to myself, wonderin&rsquo;
if maybe he&rsquo;d be in time to furnish the
Spread at the weddin&rsquo; feast.
I looked again, an&rsquo; then my mouth
got all dry an&rsquo; fuzzy.
It was one of the porters that had
carried out my stuff.Probably he had
sneaked back to try an&rsquo; find the gold,
or else some of the hunters had caught
him. In either event my hash was
cooked. When he told em what I&rsquo;d
traded to the white man-
I strained my ears. Some of our
crowd talked Fanti, an&rsquo; maybe the por-
ter talked it. He did. I heard &rsquo;em jab-
berin&rsquo; away, an&rsquo; the porter pointed at
me an&rsquo; at the stuff on the ground.
I stole a look at Yik-Yik. His eyes
was as hard as a couple of glass beads,
an&rsquo; his lips was all sucked in until his
mouth was just a network of puckered
wrinkles.
He spits out some words an&rsquo; a circle
forms around me. The goldsmith was
still there an&rsquo; he kept right on actin&rsquo;
as interpreter, but I didn&rsquo;t need to fol-
low half what he said.
An&rsquo; then, all of a sudden, I stiffened
up to real attention. It seemed the old
man was accusin&rsquo; Kk-Kk o&rsquo; betrayin&rsquo;
the tribe.
For a minute or two I thought he&rsquo;d
gone clean cuckoo, an&rsquo; then I seen just
how it looked to him.Kk-Kk was in
love with me. The monkey-man, who
she didn&rsquo;t like, had threatened to buy
her. There was a white man in the
country. What was more likely than
that she&rsquo;d slipped me out a bunch of
gold?
I TRIED to tell &rsquo;em, but they would
not listen. Kk-Kk looked all white
around the gills for a minute, an&rsquo;
then she walked over to my side.
&quot; We shall meet death together,&quot; she
said, dignified as a queen had ought
to be.  But I wasn&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to stand
for it.
I tried to tell &rsquo;em about how I had
the ants trained. I volunteered to show
em. I tried to get &rsquo;em to feed me to
the ants. But they wouldn&rsquo;t listen to
me. Kk-Kk was the only one they&rsquo;d
listen to, an&rsquo; she wouldn&rsquo;t say a word.
She wanted to die with me.
Then was when I knew I was sick
The whole ground started reelin&rsquo;
around, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;felt so drowsy I could
hardly hold my eyes open.My head
was burnin&rsquo; an&rsquo; throbbin&rsquo; an&rsquo; it seemed
as though the damp odors of the jungle
was soaked all through my blood an&rsquo;
was smotherin&rsquo; me under a blanket of
jungle mist.
Their voices sounded farther an&rsquo;
farther away.
I heard the goldsmith tellin&rsquo; me the
sentence the chief was pronouncin&rsquo;. He
had to lean up against my ear an&rsquo; shout
to make me understand.
It seemed they had a funny bread
made out of some berries an&rsquo; roots.
When a fellow ate it he lost his mem-
ory.
The old king had decided not to kill
us, but to feed us this bread an&rsquo; banish
us from the tribe.
Since we&rsquo;d committed the crime
against the tribe because we wanted to
marry,it seemed like proper justice for
the old boy to feed us king-kee, the
bread of forgetfulness, so we wouldn&rsquo;t
ever remember about the other.
It was a horrible punishment. If I
hadn&rsquo;t been comin&rsquo; down sick I&rsquo;d have
made a break an&rsquo; forced &rsquo;em to kill
me, or turned loose with the rifle an&rsquo;
seen if I couldn&rsquo;t have escaped with
Kk-Kk.
But I was a sick man.  I felt &rsquo;em
stuffin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; in my mouth, an&rsquo; I
swallowed mechanically an&rsquo; cried for
water.
Then I remember seein&rsquo; Kk-Kk&rsquo;s
eyes, all misty an&rsquo; floatin&rsquo; with tears,
bendin&rsquo; over me. Then I sank into a
sleep or stupor. Everything snuffed
out like a candle goin&rsquo; out.
Lord knows how much later I began
to come to.I was in Cape Coast Cas-
tle. They told me some natives had
brought me on a stretcher, sat me down
before the door of the buildin&rsquo; where
they kept the medicines, an&rsquo; gone away.
It had been done at night. They found
me there the next mornin&rsquo; sick with the
sleepin&rsquo; sickness.
When I woke up I couldn&rsquo;t tell &rsquo;em
who I was, where I&rsquo;d been, or how I
got there. I only knew I wanted some-
thin&rsquo; an&rsquo; couldn&rsquo;t tell what it was.
A BOAT came in, an&rsquo; they shipped
me on her. The surgeon aboard
got interested in my case. Every
time it rained I&rsquo;d sleep. There was
somethin&rsquo; in the smell of dampness in
the air.
He treated me like I&rsquo;d been a king,
an&rsquo; took me to Boston. There was
some German doctor there that had
specialized on tropical fevers. They
had me there for six months studyin&rsquo;
my case.
The doctor told me I was victim of
what he called auto-hypnosis. He said
the only reason I went to sleep when
it rained was because I thought of sleep
when it rained.
I told him it was the fever in my
blood comin&rsquo; out when it got damp,
but he just shook his head an&rsquo; said
auto-hypnosis, whatever that might
mean.
He tried for six months to get me
over it, an&rsquo; then he&rsquo;gave it up as a
bad job.
He said for me to come to Califor-
nia or Arizona an&rsquo; get out in the des-
ert, where it only rained once or twice
a year, an&rsquo; to always be in my tent
when it rained.
I followed his advice. For fifty years.
now I&rsquo;ve been livin&rsquo; out here in the
desert.
Every time it rains an&rsquo; I smell the
damp air, it acts on me like the jungle
smells when I had the sleepin&rsquo; sickness,
an&rsquo; I go to sleep. Sometimes I fall
asleep and don&rsquo;t waken for two weeks
at a stretch.
But it&rsquo;s funny about me. Now that
I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; old, my memory&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;
back to me. Particularly after I wake
up, I can recall everything like I&rsquo;ve just
told it to you.
Of course I&rsquo;m an old man now, noth-
in&rsquo; but a bum of a desert rat, out here
scratchin&rsquo; around in the sand an&rsquo; sage-
brush for a few colors of gold. I got
me a placer staked out over there at the
base of that hill.
Ain&rsquo;t it funny that I have to spend
my life lookin&rsquo; for gold, when it was
grabbin&rsquo; the gold in big chunks that
made all my troubles? Oh, well, it&rsquo;s all
in a lifetime.
Of course I&rsquo;m too old to be thinkin&rsquo;
of such things now. But. I get awful
lonesome for Kk-Kk. I can see her
round, liquid eyes shinin&rsquo; at me when-
ever I wake up from one of these long
sleeps. I wonder if she&rsquo;s got her mem-
ory comin&rsquo; back, now that she&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo;
old&ndash;an&rsquo; I wonder if she ever thinks
of me&ndash;
Yes, sir. Thankee, sir. Another cup
of that coffee will go kinda good.
When a man&rsquo;s been asleep for eight or
nine days he wakes up sorta slow. I&rsquo;ll
drink this coffee an&rsquo; then I&rsquo;ll be headin&rsquo;
over toward my placer claim.
I&rsquo;m sorry I bothered you folks, but
that rain came up mighty sudden, an&rsquo;
the first thing I knew I was soakin&rsquo;
wet an&rsquo; sleepy, smellin&rsquo; the damp smell
of the earth an&rsquo; the desert stuff. I
crawled in this bunch of Joshuay
palms, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s the last I remember
until you came along an&rsquo; poured the hot
coffee down me.
No, thanks, I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ll stay
any longer.
My tent&rsquo;s fixed up mighty comfort-
able over there, an&rsquo; when I wake up
this way it seems like I&rsquo;ve been with
Kk-Kk in a dream world. I like to
think about my lost sweetheart.
So long, boys. Thanks for the cof-
fee.</p>
